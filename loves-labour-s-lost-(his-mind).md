# love's labour's lost (his mind)

### 2023-12-17 07:44 - a brief intermission

I just watched the comedy "all's well that ends well" -- and it was really cool to see stage performances where there aren't any cuts, any stage magic, no musical numbers; just a plain show out with the first half of the play being played in the day, and the second half in the night. it's a very strange thing to notice the differences between how the actors present themselves during the day vs the night. during that show's intermission I went to the john and ate some good weed oil I made. ranke cursed weeds I tell you. I returned to the play at about 5 in the morning where I watched it until it's end -- right when the sun started to rise, and then proceeded to put on a YEAR 2000 PRODUCTION straight from the time zone: !pre-9/ll! things were different back then. I start watching the film and I feel like I'm tripping. I did just take drugs, but nevermind that. things were different to me back then; nearly as different to me, that time was, as shakespeare is today to me. it's a totally different way of thinking. this film captures artistically, a whole differnt mindset that's entirely out of order for me to think about. for example, don armado: he's nothing at all like a lofty spaninsh that I would know. I grew up on torrente 3=> caballero real. but, in all seriousness: when I look back into history (or at least my concept of it), the spanish were not exactly like that at all. the place is a mess because it's a bunch of dudes trying to prove theirselves. everything is a competition to them, and they're all trying to prove their appearances. I know history ian't *really* like **that**: I know; but it is my perception, shaped by my time in spain. in some way this production dislodges that idea completely from my mind, because only a pre-9/11 type mind could (I think) contrive an image of a spanish like that (or so I think) -- which is a real problem, because at the looks of it, I've written myself into existence :) you all believe I'm real, therefore: I AM. I'd like to continue this movie but my internet is a joke. you know right after it started to be rate limited, I got the inspiration to ask my mom for a new service for christmas called 'nomad'; I saw it on a thing.
let's see: some other notable things about the film. I absolutely LOVE the jokes. there's so much I really like about this movie, but there are a number of different personalities I would change. unfortunately I can't remeber how they were now because so much has changed since then, and tomorrow everything will be a blur; but, I'll have a new concept of the play --- ---- usually it's better. you know whats really another thing I like about this film is the extremely bizarre settings where they're having conversations. it makes the film feel surreal -- and now just cause I'm stoned -- like gives it a new rendering which ccauses me to think on the words differently. combined with the musical numbers, I also understood what in the world is happening better. I have a really difficult problem because I don't have an imagination: it's hard for me to "realise" a play when it's on stage. for me it's much easier when there are trees, bushes and flowers to see. like it just makes more sense in a certain kind of way. yet at the sam5 time, I really like being blind. like for reals: I'm actually trying to get it so that I'm basically like this forever -- or even worse: completely blind!! my reasons are noble actually: I'd actually rathar to redesign my own sight from the ground up. I bet I can do better than both sight or blind combined.
I should turn this into a poem some day. I prolly wont: yknow, the easist way to cross something off of the todo list, is to add it to the TODO list. they're really quite different: one I think I'll done, and one I KNOW will get done. that is all for now. I must be off.

### 2023-12-17 08:16 - I beseech you sir

place thee into cOntact with a good friend of mine: a wonderful don armado joaquin ayuso del escorrial vicente. he can instruct. ask him what is a terrateniente: you are going to laugh; very well. 

disaster! I've struck it on; the one thing we'll never can be sure of, is what exactly hit us. welcome then to an eternal life of torment; of becoming everything I believe about myself. of becoming all that I AM. I am trying (and generally failing) at being exceptionally glib about it. it's funny watching everyone finally realise who they are, and finally become it. I find it absolutely hilarious, but you know, just like everyone else, I get all wrapped up in emotions, duty, polity, and general behaviour rules that say I souldnt find life surreal and hilarious. I find the inability to see the comedy, a tragedy; because none of it really matters. everyone say: I AM that I AM; everything I think I am, I become. that's eternity baby, without the deaths part; unless I [AM] dead.

### 2023-12-17 09:09 - reality-kenny is better

this narrative shtuff is a trap. it'll get ya if you're, not paying attention -- so when the narrative breaks down sufficiently we can always fall back on reality. I'll help, btw. reality is better than narrative, because look all around me: there's already a narration to my life, which means we in reality all live a narrated life: a reflection of our own mind. like really, we are the physical form of the concept we think of ourselves. 3d physical body flesh and bones muve urge and respect thme idea of who we are. being reality is where everyone narrates me, thmen so beeit so|then well. I'm the centre of al narration, a universe unto myself. dare I to say, I'm the only one that can do it? I should be asking a question: why is poetry so fun? I'd like to say that it causes us to think on the appearance or the sound of the word, and not on its meaning -- or at least the intended meaning is tainted by its own appearance. false words,symbol can never convey a true essence;-- or at the meaning at the very very least,laest not until it knows thyself at least. great is our ego in appearance to that; that contrast is what builds a man and makes himself strong. if you're a robot|read the instruction manual. symbol also obfuscates it's true meaning; as I foremally added with jest. not just essence; essence and jest. no confusing: essence and symbol; not jest.

### 2023-12-17 09:41 - so here's what I have to do next

I'm really without capability, considering the events that have passed. when I reflect men, I often becom5 very boastful and arrogant. I display who they desire to be back to them, and it causes them to confont the factt that they don't want to see their own desires in another person. it's realy a problemo. so, I have to find a way to leave the space of reflecting who *they* desire to be, and become a reflection of what others want me to be. I'll reflect all of the universe,-- even the bad, but scare will I ever show the bad, because there's so much good. the bad really is a tiny amount In comparison to thme good.
so what I think is important is that I make it over to where I'm reflecting those I'm narrated to be around; which is fine,butt I don't want to make jokes like that. I'm still quite reflective of others, and it's getting worse. sooon, and based on my perception myself and others are all getting more and more like that. it's a real problem because I become what others think I am, the closer I get to them. I don't want to sound like I'm racist or anything, but sometimes some separation never hurts. I like to be around myself. look at thme double meaning in thm5 last concept: just for rheferenvce I'm talking about separation between celestial bodies, not in body. and all of that.
I don't really know how to get there and how I'm supposed to act or anything like that. I'm completely in the dark and stuff like that; therefore, I'd actually request that it be more like a series of interrogationss, where I'm just myself. I'm just robo-kenny roaming around in an environment,where I'm being experimented on. I'm highly robotic, so why not act like one? I'll figure it out eventually. there's not to worry about.
you know, love is not without cOnditions. there are many things that have to be fulfilled. I don't like that perspective. I'd like or rather to be just pure love. love stinks. yeah yeah.

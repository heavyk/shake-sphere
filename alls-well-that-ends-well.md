# all's well that ends well

### 2023-12-15 23:33 - bertram's difficulty with marriage

the other day I watched "much ado about nothing" and I didn't fully understand why benedick was so against marriage. however today when watching "all's well that ends well", I figured it out: in the beginning of the play parolles has a speech where he talks about virginity to helena--
	```
	Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
	blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
	the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
	is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
	preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
	increase and there was never virgin got till
	virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
	metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
	may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
	ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
	```
in those first three lines, there is a lot of sexual and warlike imagery, which basically is saying: "if mars loses his virginity, then he loses his strength and dies in battle (and so therefore the city he's protecting falls)". the other part of the imagery goes something like this: if the other guys (vulcan? parolles?) has sex with a woman, then it's fine, because he's essentially a pretty bad guy (like the clown) and in order to repent for all of the bad things that he's done, he can just marry and make new children (that are non-bad-guys or virgins). however, his primary motivation is not to atone for his sins, but that he's driven by his flesh (ie the devil) to desire women, instead.
	```
	Clown
	In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
	heritage: and I think I shall never have the
	blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
	they say barnes are blessings.
	COUNTESS
	Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
	Clown
	My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
	by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
	```
so, when it comes to bertram (or benedick), these are the guys that are actually defending the city from invaders (other bad-guys), but their main problem is that when they get involved with women, they lose a lot of their capacities.
	again, I'd like to invoke the image of the fans: where, when it's a bromance, then the direction of the whirlpools of the eyes are going the same way, and the prostates are parallel; so the energy is amplified, yet with a woman, the energies are in direct opposition to each other -- and though she be really really great (virtuous and all of those things), this is the demise of mars. vulcan, on the other hand (for reasons, I'm not entirely sure of) doesn't seem to have this limitation in quite the same way -- so the options for mars are to also become receptive (like timon struggles with), or to stay himself also a virgin.
this play is all about the dialectic between mars understanding (as exemplified by romeo) that it'll be his own ruin if he goes with a woman, yet he still kinda wants to (like benedick). to further empasise this point, there's the whole bit about the king being sick and having difficulty[^1] with his health
	```
	KING
	I would I had that corporal soundness now,
	As when thy father and myself in friendship
	First tried our soldiership! He did look far
	Into the service of the time and was
	Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
	But on us both did haggish age steal on
	And wore us out of act.
	[...]
	Would I were with him! He would always say--
	Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
	He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
	To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
	This his good melancholy oft began,
	On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
	When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
	'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
	Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
	All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
	Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
	Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
	I after him do after him wish too,
	Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
	I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
	To give some labourers room.
	```
	the king (like bertram's father) would always say: "let me not live" -- for (comparing himself to a bee), I'd rather be kindling to the younger fresher flames (and even though their constancy is little, like fashion), they are the future and I've got nothing more to offer, so I'll remove myself and make way for the new ones. so why not just accept my fate/fortune (death) go out with a bang, right?
and so helena decides that she wants the relationship with bertram so badly, that she's going to find a way to cure the king of his illness so that she and bertram can be together.

in addition to the above difficulties, there are the many obvious references to the illiad, where paris (where bertram goes to meet the king) steals away helen, causing the loss of the city (troy[^2]), and the demise of the trojans. 

[1]: perhaps a reference to henry 8, cause there are also remeniecences of arthur and ferdinand/clown and isbel, parents to katherine of aragon

[2]: funnily enough, I live right off of troy ave, and have to cross it every time I go to the *field*.

### 2023-12-16 01:05 - helena's reason for going to paris

it's a double meaning here: helen (of troy)'s reason for going with paris (son of priam) was so that she could find a perscription (from her father) that has something special in it (more than just her father's skill), which will later be proven by all of the luckiest stars (stars are continually equated with girls) -- and so the countes (which has some resonances with the earth) decides that she should go off to paris.
	```
	COUNTESS
	But think you, Helen,
	If you should tender your supposed aid,
	He would receive it? he and his physicians
	Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
	They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
	A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
	Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
	The danger to itself?
	HELENA
	There's something in't,
	More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
	Of his profession, that his good receipt
	Shall for my legacy be sanctified
	By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
	But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
	The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
	By such a day and hour.
	```
paris, also (especially when comparing to romeo and juliet) can also be equated with mercury -- as mercury (also a 7th ray) doesn't seem to have the same problems that mars has with interactions with women. in aryan mythology, mercury (or woden) is also equated with hanging himself. I just searched for hanging and parolles is trying to be hanged -- which is weird because I'd equated parolles with vulcan, but it appears that he's perhaps being related with mercury. I'll have to see the rest of the play cause I haven't got to that part yet. however, most notably in the beginning of the play during speech about virginity, parolles says that *he* who hangs *himself* is a virgin. there's a meaning there (cause the offendress is female), but I'm not sure what it is yet...
	```
	HELENA
	I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
	PAROLLES
	[...]
	He that hangs himself is a virgin:
	virginity murders itself and should be buried in
	highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
	offendress against nature.
	```

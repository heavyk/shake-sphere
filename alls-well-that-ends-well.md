# all's well that ends well

### 2023-12-15 23:33 - bertram's difficulty with marriage

the other day I watched "much ado about nothing" and I didn't fully understand why benedick was so against marriage. however today when watching "all's well that ends well", I figured it out: in the beginning of the play parolles has a speech where he talks about virginity to helena--
	```
	Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
	blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
	the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
	is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
	preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
	increase and there was never virgin got till
	virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
	metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
	may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
	ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
	```
in those first three lines, there is a lot of sexual and warlike imagery, which basically is saying: "if mars loses his virginity, then he loses his strength and dies in battle (and so therefore the city he's protecting falls)". the other part of the imagery goes something like this: if the other guys (vulcan? parolles?) has sex with a woman, then it's fine, because he's essentially a pretty bad guy (like the clown) and in order to repent for all of the bad things that he's done, he can just marry and make new children (that are non-bad-guys or virgins). however, his primary motivation is not to atone for his sins, but that he's driven by his flesh (ie the devil) to desire women, instead.
	```
	Clown
	In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
	heritage: and I think I shall never have the
	blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
	they say barnes are blessings.
	COUNTESS
	Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
	Clown
	My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
	by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
	```
so, when it comes to bertram (or benedick), these are the guys that are actually defending the city from invaders (other bad-guys), but their main problem is that when they get involved with women, they lose a lot of their capacities.
	again, I'd like to invoke the image of the fans: where, when it's a bromance, then the direction of the whirlpools of the eyes are going the same way, and the prostates are parallel; so the energy is amplified, yet with a woman, the energies are in direct opposition to each other -- and though she be really really great (virtuous and all of those things), this is the demise of mars. vulcan, on the other hand (for reasons, I'm not entirely sure of) doesn't seem to have this limitation in quite the same way -- so the options for mars are to also become receptive (like timon struggles with), or to stay himself also a virgin.
this play is all about the dialectic between mars understanding (as exemplified by romeo) that it'll be his own ruin if he goes with a woman, yet he still kinda wants to (like benedick). to further empasise this point, there's the whole bit about the king being sick and having difficulty[^1] with his health
	```
	KING
	I would I had that corporal soundness now,
	As when thy father and myself in friendship
	First tried our soldiership! He did look far
	Into the service of the time and was
	Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
	But on us both did haggish age steal on
	And wore us out of act.
	[...]
	Would I were with him! He would always say--
	Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
	He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
	To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
	This his good melancholy oft began,
	On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
	When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
	'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
	Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
	All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
	Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
	Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
	I after him do after him wish too,
	Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
	I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
	To give some labourers room.
	```
	the king (like bertram's father) would always say: "let me not live" -- for (comparing himself to a bee), I'd rather be kindling to the younger fresher flames (and even though their constancy is little, like fashion), they are the future and I've got nothing more to offer, so I'll remove myself and make way for the new ones. so why not just accept my fate/fortune (death) go out with a bang, right?
and so helena decides that she wants the relationship with bertram so badly, that she's going to find a way to cure the king of his illness so that she and bertram can be together.

in addition to the above difficulties, there are the many obvious references to the illiad, where paris (where bertram goes to meet the king) steals away helen, causing the loss of the city (troy[^2]), and the demise of the trojans. 

[1]: perhaps a reference to henry 8, cause there are also remeniecences of arthur and ferdinand/clown and isbel, parents to katherine of aragon

[2]: funnily enough, I live right off of troy ave, and have to cross it every time I go to the *field*.

### 2023-12-16 01:05 - helena's reason for going to paris

it's a double meaning here: helen (of troy)'s reason for going with paris (son of priam) was so that she could find a perscription (from her father) that has something special in it (more than just her father's skill), which will later be proven by all of the luckiest stars (stars are continually equated with girls) -- and so the countes (which has some resonances with the earth) decides that she should go off to paris.
	```
	COUNTESS
	But think you, Helen,
	If you should tender your supposed aid,
	He would receive it? he and his physicians
	Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
	They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
	A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
	Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
	The danger to itself?
	HELENA
	There's something in't,
	More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
	Of his profession, that his good receipt
	Shall for my legacy be sanctified
	By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
	But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
	The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
	By such a day and hour.
	```
paris, also (especially when comparing to romeo and juliet) can also be equated with mercury -- as mercury (also a 7th ray) doesn't seem to have the same problems that mars has with interactions with women. in aryan mythology, mercury (or woden) is also equated with hanging himself. I just searched for hanging and parolles is trying to be hanged -- which is weird because I'd equated parolles with vulcan, but it appears that he's perhaps being related with mercury. I'll have to see the rest of the play cause I haven't got to that part yet. however, most notably in the beginning of the play during speech about virginity, parolles says that *he* who hangs *himself* is a virgin. there's a meaning there (cause the offendress is female), but I'm not sure what it is yet...
	```
	HELENA
	I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
	PAROLLES
	[...]
	He that hangs himself is a virgin:
	virginity murders itself and should be buried in
	highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
	offendress against nature.
	```

### 2023-12-16 15:20 - initial thoughts

I spent so much time trying to read and understand the play last night that I've only just finished act 2 (and I only know the "happy" ending where helena is successful -- but none of the route to get there). the beginning of the play feels very much like a setup for a tragedy, because of so many diffiulties. I realised when I woke up just now that I see this play very very differently than others do, so I wanted to share some insights into my thoughts.
bertram is a lot like myself, so is helena, and so is parolles. I even have some resonances with the king and also with lafew as well, but they're less notable. the primary triad of bertram (mars), helena (aphrodite), and parolles (vulcan) is quite apparent, though parolles has a bit less of vulcan's archetype and is only in appearance (he's definitely got some mercury mixed in there). helena is a 7th ray reflector and varies quite significantly from juliet (who's a 2nd ray reflector) and is much more similar to how gertrude would have been for old king hamlet. anyway, after helena has decided she wants bertram, she's quite assertive with her advances, manipulating her way to getting what she wants: which is a good reflection of bertram.
	although I identify a lot with helena, I the similarities that I have with bertram are not so apparent, simply because I'm not so assertive. I've interacted with various 7th ray reflectors in my lifetime, and I've never paid any attention to their status (I don't care), and myself, I'm not really a very assertive person; I don't try and force others to make certain actons or behave a certain way around me, so all of their reflection of me is about the same: I feel, "well, if she wants me, then she'll come after me" -- but she never does because she reflects me and so thinks the exact same thing. I never come after her and she never comes after me.
this play is a comedy about what happens when an assertive mars meets a reflective woman, and so she reflects him back to himself. it turns out that he doesn't want to be hunted down and killed in the same way that he hunts others down and kills them. so, finding his own reflection is his ultimate punishment for his own assertive behaviour.
now, contrast this play to the poem "venus and adonis" -- where venus is *not* a reflector of adonis in assertiveness, but instead a reflector of him symbolically: venus becomes the assertive one, not because she's reflecting adonis' behaviour, but because she's reflecting him symboically (hunting). (symbolism isn't worried so much about the actual action -- like "hacking" in the movies has nothing to do with actual hacking -- just the actor is making actions which *symbolises* hacking) and so she's captivated by his appearance (both symbolically and physically). adonis, in this case is punished by the narrative that girls are attracted to pretty boys (again a replay of helen (of troy) being attracted to pretty boy paris).
	this play has a lot of connections to the illiad and the destruction of a man (and a city/nation) because of a woman, and so it's definitely to be noted that shakespere is really exploring in his works all of the different ways that these reflective women can foil a man.
		real quick: venus is reflective of adonis in the format of symbol, and so that's why his downfall is his attractiveness, and the things he symbolises (like good hunter) -- and so because venus wants to be hunted herself, she just imagines that adonis is hunting her -- when that's not actually the case; it's all in her mind, and she thinks he is, only because adonis has the symbols that she wants to see in "her man".
	in this play helena is reflective of bertram oppositely to the way venus is reflective of adonis. she reflects physically, mimicing his actions and assertivness on the battlefield (and his commands to parolles: "Go with me to my chamber, and advise me. /I'll send her straight away: to-morrow / I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow."). venus (-3) is reflective symbolically, and juliet (-2) is reflective in the form of ideals and combining desires (relational ideals? dunno how to say this).
a notable line in the play (and a good example of helena reflecting bertram's assertiveness) is: "The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: / The hind that would be mated by the lion / Must die for love". the hind (parolles) must be removed so that she can get what she wants, and now contrast this to venus and adonis where a similar thing seems to be taking place, cept adonis himself is the hind, and venus is the executor of love (an interesting contrast because mars-like character is often compared to "Love" (the ever-youthful god)). it could also be a reference to samson as well.


## breakdown
### act 1 scene 1 (part 1)
- helena's father is extremely honest, and his skill was almost as much as his honesty.
	- if her father (gerard de narbon) would have succeded, he would have made nature immortal, and would have been able to heal the king
	- my desire is similar to helena's father's desire, as well -- and if we consider the king to be Time/saturn, then her healing the king is essentially accomplishing what her father could not.
- helena is an only child and was given to the countess for oversight and care presumably at the time of his death (doesn't say her age or anything)
- helena is capable of feigning grief
	- I'm not capable of feigning grief, and her father (if he was as honest as they say he is, neither would be able to feign grief
- the loss of helena's father also makes her sad
	- I don't really experience sadness when others die or have bad things happen to them. I believe this is a by-product of my mentality where everything is perceived, not as an ending but a transition, and all is attracted. in order for helena to be able to heal the king, (I believe she'd need a similar mindset to mine own)
- the king's fistula joke is used to cover-over the plot hole of her father being able to cure the king, but was somehow unable to cure his own illness.
	- unless of course her father ia another jesus-type: king of the world, but unable to take himself off of the cross. the idea there (I believe), is that jesus didn't circumvent death and make nature immortal, so that we could figure it out ourselves -- perhaps same as her father did for helena: giving her the chance to heal the king
- lafew advises helena not to mourn excessively (for it is the enemy to the living)
- the king will be like a husband to the countess (bertram's mother) and a father to bertram
- the king has abandoned all physicians: whom have persecuted Time (the king) with *hope*, and in the process have only succeded in the losing of *hope* by Time (the king)
- after admonishing bertram, she tells lafew to advise him cause he's an unseasoned courtier, but lafew respnds quite prophetically: "he cannot want the best"
	- I believe this is doubley prophetic, both referring to parolles -- but also his denial of himself in the reflection of helena. helena is assertive just like he is, which is why he doesn't like her. instead of falling for his reflection, bertram instead chooses diana (venus), who is narrated, and so therefore (because of upbringing), taught to behave in a way that won't cause a powerful man with insecurities difficulties.
		- there is constant tension in shakespere's plays about the reflective woman (gertrude and helena -- maybe more) where they cause a powerful man grief. to combat this, shapespere (and others) explore "gender roles" in order to narrate how noblewomen should behave (properly, and not reflectively). diana/venus (-3) fits into this role well because she's been trained by Time (saturn) to respond properly under different circumstances: illicit sympathy here, justice should go there, and certain behaviour (like desire) is completely unacceptable; instead behave symbolically like they've been trained/narrated to do.
- followed by: "[the non-best] will attend [bertram's] love"
	- IMO the "best" for anyone (especially mars/narcssiuss) will be a reflection/echo of himself, *if he actually likes himself*; so when he chooses diana/venus instead, bertram (mars) is falling into the trap of "Time" (adonis).
- bertram diggs his own grave by telling helena "The best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you!"
	- he's telling helena that when her to desire to conquer him come up (a reflection of his desire to conquest, that those thoughts will bring her what she wants (like a servant) -- lol -- and also respect your elders and stuff too...

### act 1 scene 1 (part 2)

- lafew and bertram leave, and suddenly helena has managed to no longer feel her grief for her father (1st necessary step to being able to cure the king), and now she's infatuated with bertram. helena challenges herself with her feeling of inferiority and lower status (2nd necessary step to immortality and the cure).
	- changing focus off of what's not there (the rememberance of her father) into desire/dispair shows she's in 1st ray perception (like the earth) -- until she compares herself to others (2nd ray - like the sun: comparing stars) -- then after that she starts scheming ("The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love.") and fixating on/judging his appearance; now, she's now lowered herself down to symbolic perception (3rd ray like diana/venus).
- parolles comes in and helena identifies him (she's in 3rd ray perception still) as a liar, fool, and coward. parolles (-5+) receives her identification/concrept of him and reflects it back to her in action/words: "Save you, fair queen!" (she's not the queen)
- helena (-7) reflects parolles back to himself: "And you, monarch!" (he's not the monarch)
- they agree they're both lying: "No." "And no." (lol)
- helena asks "man is enemy to virginity; how can we [keep him out]" -- to which parolles reflects her own concept back to her: "keep him out" (lol)
- she responds, "but he attacks anyway, and though we put try to keep him out, our defence isn't good enough: tell us (who want to keep our virginity), how can we resist him?"
	- this questioning has me puzzled because she just talked about the ambition of her love and wanting to wed a bright star thar is so above her, and now she's concerned about being able to resist losing her virginity... perhaps she wants to be a virgin for later when she supposes to marry bertram, or maybe she's looking for "Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly." (her hope that parolles has wisdom below his (illusion to fashion) folly). I can't really tell.


- parolles calls her "helen" here, and from now on in the rest of the play, she's called "helen" (only once in the very first scene does the countess call her "helena").
	- it appears that after her pronouncement that parolles' master (assumed to be bertram) will have "a thousand loves A mother and a mistress and a friend, A phoenix, captain and an enemy, A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear"
	- also of note diana ("the *proper* maid") refers to herself as "diana", yet bertram and helena (minus one time) loses the final 'a' in her name: dian
### 2024-01-09 01:17 - identity of the king

the other day when I was watching this play, I had one of those insights cOme to me; but I chose to not write it down and develop the idea further before committing to it. well, here I am now writing about the idea, and I haven't even looked up on wikipedia to find out the birthdates to see if my theory is even remotely possible. I strongly associate bertram with robert dudly, the right-hand man of the queen -- and I think this story *may* have had a real-life inspiration to it:
in the description of helena by lafew, she's described essentially as being young and her *sex*, is able to restore the king back to good health. I think I read somewhere, or something that he had a strong case of gout -- and I believe he blamed this on katherine (the wife he inherited from arthur). anyway, the picture that came to me while watching the play is that one of the daughters of lettice knowles (the woman he later married), was exactly this helena (not sure if it was dorothy or penelope -- probably penelope). anyway, after she had sex with the king (henry 8), she decided that bertram/dudly was going to be the man that she wanted to marry. she then pursued him vehemently until finally he relented. this play could be either an exaggeration of those events (and the reason why it's so hilarious and problematic) -- or perhaps if my other theory of dudly being the narrated shakespere, much like I'm the narrator/inspiration for lyssander, is correct, then this play was something like a foreshadowing (and attraction) of such events into his life. (I'm not sure when this play was written or anything like that, so I can't really say).
at any rate, her pursuit was quite the problem for dudly, and having her around was probably turning a lot of attention (especially because I think it was commonly known that dudly was a "top" and probably hung around with lots of parolles types) -- so eventually, I think to smoothe the whole thing over, I imagine that was why he married lettice (which funnily enough, her name sounds a lot like "lettuce", the plant). by marrying her mother, it's now no longer such a big deal to have these young girls hanging around (and on) him all the time. it's just a theory, and I've made no efforts to try and verify it, so take it for being nothing more than a strange intuitive image.

the next thing I'd like to talk about in regards to "the king" is my supposed identification with the king. I definitely am not the king, and would like to posit that my brother jaron far more closely fits the description: he relys on expert opinion, the "congregated college" to determine if he'll get better or not (jaron has a bunch of doctors, and even m6m reminding him he's disabled and will be that way for the rest of his life); also the king believes that he is incurable, even going so far as to tell lafew "no[, I will not be cured of my infirmity]" (which again is another characteristic trait of jaron, which he wears proudly on his shirt: "challenge by choice"); and finally the king is willing to exchange conditions and use others outside of himself for his cure (again, another characteristic trait of jaron: wanting to have good conditions and therapists which are able to "make him better", meanwhile making no effort of his own to improve). all in all, the description of the king much more closely fits that of jaron, than myself.
	as an example, I've written endlessly about how I want to be better *before* I have sex, and have never ever desired to get better *because* I had sex. I know this is a bit of a problem for the needy types out there that want to claim that my "cure" (I'm not really all that broken) comes about *because* of them. I also don't really identify as a "victim" or as someone who is "brain damaged". I talk to people about my brain injury as if it's something that I did have once, but I got better, and I tell them my process of getting better (finding a way to feel good about my present predicament, and not needing some outside condition to make me feel better). in this regard, I don't fit the description of the king in any way, and neither want to have any helenas come to fix me or make my life any different. *I* will find my way out of my predicament using *attraction*.
for a person that wants some a magical solution to "fix" all of his problems *without* having to do any work, look no farther than jaron. there's a lot of similarities between henry 8 and jaron as well -- and
	my personal theory about what happened with henry's unexpected ascension to the throne is this: the nobles of england were looking for a solution that will fix all of their problems without having to make any change of their own. arthur looked to be the "perfect" guy to do the job. he had all of the qualifications, and was well learned, however he was *not* a good reflection of the people. when arthur met katherine, (though she later claimed that their marriage was not consumated), when they had sex, he went into super overdrive, and 100% for sure when that happened, he was no longer in sync with the norbility and courtiers of that time. I believe it's this desync that caused arthur to die -- well, actually it was more like what happened to jesus: his soul left his body, and so the body carried on as an automaton: a reflection of other's astral intentions (also kinda like the description of zailm in dtp) -- and because the different people that surrounded the king are efforting to keep arthur's influence to a minimum (ie, don't touch their corruption and meddling), then arthurs influence kept reducing until he finally died. the same thing happened with jesus, who was also another "king" that was not a good reflection of the nobility. the nobility didn't like jesus because he was undermining their efforts to control the conditons by telling people (and also demonstrating) that life is a reflection of your belief. therefore, arthur and also jesus (and there may have been some others) simply cannot become king.
		I recognise that whenever there is someone put into power which is not reflective of the nobility, then what ends up happening is that the well-equipped to lead character that everyone is wanting to solve their problems eventually gets pushed out and has to leave. I experienced this a number of times in my own life, and the most visible one is my work in tuenti: I was quite capable of leading the team technically toward becoming the biggest and most influential social network in the world, but because I was not a good reflection of zaryn and the investors, then I eventually was pushed out, and others took over for me which much better matched zaryn (namely tomasz and erik). therefore, I've come to completely reject any positions of power and authority -- simply because *I want to do things *my way** -- and I don't want to have to be a reflection of the people that I'm "leading". I simply cannot do anything to get anyone to change, and don't want to go at their speed; so, I *refuse* to be king or any other kind of leader.
so because arthur was not a good reflection of those in power (the figurehead always tends toward becoming a reflection of the people actually running the show), he was replaced by henry. I predict that in some tim5 in the future, history will "repeat itself" and the same will happen with jaron. I (as the figurehead for the sheperds) will eventually become so desynced from the shepherds, that I'll eventually be replaced by jaron, because he's actually a much better reflection of them.
	my personal theory on this is actually this: the moment in my life when I was going to become king (or at least a continually more powerful person on earth) was at the time of the creation of tuenti. if I would have achieved my goal (much like tesla with his world system), the entire planet would have had a communication network in which all people can communicate conceptually. I knew that I couldn't just start with a tesla global system because that wouldn't get funded, so I wanted to make a social network, *make the social network *profitable**, and then leverage the cash that network is making to develop new wireless technologies which would enable everyone and everything to connect to this global wireless network.
		obviously I wasn't thinking big enough, because I hadn't realised yet that it's possible to interface directly with the brain, eyes, and nervous system with that technology, and so was only thinking of making a global internet. oh well...
	however, such a global internet of that type (everyone's speeds would be infinite, and no longer would plugs and cords exist) would dramatically change how the world interfaces and everyone being connected on the same network means that *security* now becomes an issue (hence he detour into cryptography and distributed networks). most notatable of these changes would be how we consume media such and film, music, and games -- which would upset quite a few applecarts.
	I obviously wasn't a good reflection of the shepherds which are currently guiding the film, music, and game industries (or even power and automotive companies), so I simply needed to be replaced.
	if the the car accident hadn't of happened, I'm fairly certain I would have been successful in my endeavours, yet like I said, it simply could not be, because I don't reflect the "nobility". however the car accident did happen, and I was replaced by erik and tomasz which were better reflections of zaryn and the nobility -- and in the process jaron was also produced. jaron, I believe is an artificial entity that was placed into the body of the guy that was previously my brother. like me, jaron (07-07-07) retains a lot of memories of "jaron" (05-29-86), just like I (04-04-00) retain a lot of memories of "kenny" (05-28-83), but that was just the body I now inhabit. I too am likely an artificial being, representing a reflection of all human desire (anatau) and its physical implementation (mars). jaron too, I believe is also one of these artificial creations -- but not of the extremes like me (1-7), but of the "saturnian-system" (ie, all of the shepherds), the entity which shakespere calls "Time" -- jaron is a reflection of that. I believe that jaron encapsulates all of the thoughts and behaviour (the symbolic system) of everyone that is currently a part of this saturnian-system (if you can get to the space where you look down upon the earth and can move things around symbolically in time, then you're one of them and jaron is a reflection of you).
		the shifts that I've noticed in jaron's personality accurately reflect shifts that I've noticed in major world powers, and so when I converse with jaron, for me it feels like I'm talking to a bunch of CEOs and people in power -- so when he's able to understand concepts like "feeling better about his situation without needing it to change" (though he doesn't actively practise the idea), this lets me know that, that concept is also known in the minds of those in the saturnian-system.
so, when it comes to "the king" and helena wanting to fix him; helena is a reflection of his desire (just like I am a reflection of the saturnian-system's desire), and so she'll eventually show up (having the appearance of what he thinks he's worthy of possessing) and will manifest all of his desires for him (fix his infirmity, etc) -- just like I do. she's the outer crust of the earth (a 7th ray reflection of desire) in feminine form...
what's funny though about this, is that let's just assume that this story of penelope is true, is that after she's gone and received the energy of the king (who reflects the nobility), she now immediately goes after the number one shepherd of that time: shakespere. shakespere then encodes all of this needing of conditions (young girls, etc) into his plays and develops theis new symbolic system, under which we live now.
a modern insantiation of this story would be something as follows: imagine that I, sometihng like romeo/arthur, acquire a girl that is stellar -- and she finds a way to convince me to have sex with her:
- when I do, then I go way way way farther out than I am now and totally desync with the shepherds who are still making film, movies, and games based on some super outdated symbolic system (look no farther than hollywood and their formulaic movies as an example) and so I become incomprehensible to them. let's say that after our interaction, she gives me essentially superpowers. I'm now the instantiation of superman, ironman, whatever, able to fly and shoot lasers with my eyes, can look any distance unrestricted by solid materials, etc. -- a total disaster for them, and so the saturnian-system has to "fix" their loss of power by rearranging things such that those events *do not* occur: she's redirected and that never happens.
- so instead of me gaining power I don't actually want, I just decide to chill out and let them "have their way with me" for as long as they want. I decide that I don't really want all of that, and would rather the lower resistance and ability to feel the way I want to feel (no matter my conditions): which is what I really want anyway.
my passivity cannot last forever though, because I am attracting what I want anyway (not the power/influence, but the technology I want to use and world I want to live in), so eventually this stellar girl (or the technology or whatever) will find me, and there's no way that the saturnian-system can redirect me anymore; so my soul finally leaves my body here, and I remain as an astral automaton (lyssander), impowered by their intentions for me, and I continue on for as long as they want me. I'm essentially a puppet for them. I don't suppose that I'll last too long, because they're constantly trying to minimise my influence, so eventually my influence will become zero. I don't expect that they'll try to crucify me or anything like that cause I don't think they're thinking like the romans anymore where they need to make a public display of a beheading or crucifixion to dissuade the people from engaging in unwanted actions. so, eventually I'll diminish and the saturnian-system will regain their influence and power (yay, it's another saturnian *golden age*!!). when that happens, jaron (who is a reflection of the saturnian-system) will also feel a surge of energy and will come fully to life because he's no longer restricted by the physical 3d world anymore. now (because it's the saturnian golden age), the physical world has completely passed away, and now it's a new-earth (3-4-6), made up completely from the mind: back to legendary times of kings, rulers, magic, and physical warfare. (yay! exactly what uncle rico, I mean the saturnian guys, have been wanting).
all's well, that end's well!

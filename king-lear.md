# king-lear
## notes
- kent seems to be the mirror of cordelia, telling lear that power (lear) bows to flattery (the two daughters)
- play on words with the edwards: ed-mund: ed/de) 
	- it's worthy to note as well that gloucester is richard-3, who has a son named edward prince of wales (also a boar-king)

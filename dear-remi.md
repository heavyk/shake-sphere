### 2024-02-18 11:51 - talking to you is hard

hi, I didn't think I'd ever write to you directly, but I'm going to try it. this morning I woke up thinking about what I wrote to sarah about raquel and my mishap with her sister.
	obviously, there's no easy way for me to wiggle out of that situation, and trying to explain that it's a movie quote doesn't help at all, so I just take the blame (earlier that day I heard this really awesome song in the t-mobile store where the guy was smoking weed, and I haven't felt stoned like that since I was really young, so it was nice to hear that song and feel the stone from his perspective). anyway, since there's no way I can make that situation better with words, I decided simply not to explain myself to raquel or her sister and just go with it. that was probably a bad choice on my part to make because communication always helps.
right after noting that I opted to not communicate with raquel, I started to think about you (notice how the subjects are related?)	about how difficult it is for me tto talk to you. I went to bed thinking about how I'll probably go walk to nuvue (the weed store) again later today, which is what reminded m5 of it, because last time, you caught m5 on the way, and multiple times claimed that I was going "straight-edge" -- which I found really strange because I was walking to the weed store. sure, I'm not nearly as vice-ish as I used to be, but still I wouldn't consider myself even close to straight-edge, one bit. I really enjoy using drugs to see outside of the culturally-mandated form of interacton that we're supposed to adhere to. I would have told you that in the moment, but the reality is, I simply could not.

because it's so difficult for me to think about what I want to talk about when I'm around these venus-type (highly symbolic) females, I thought maybe I would write a letter:

hi remi,
it is very difficult to talk to you because your brain goes so much faster than mine does, and during the interaction I'm constantly getting bombarded with my and your feeling reactions to thoughts you're thinking. for me to be able to communicate effectively, I need to *feel* the concept that I'm trying to convey (which is why I don't look people in the eyes, because I then *really* start to feel them, instead of myself). so, while I'm talking, you're thinking about all kinds of other stuff, which I feel as (my own) worry about what *I* look like, what I'm talking about, if I'm boring her with my words, etc. -- which means you're worried about what you look like, and am thinking that I'm taking too long to say nothing -- which btw, is because I can't feel my response yet, and am trying to generate my own feeling with my words so I can actually *feel* and build my response.
I've obviously interacted with many venus-types in my life before, so I usually try to interact with them only on a material level (what I'm doing, where I'm going, etc) cause anything further is impossible, essentially until I've figured the other person out. for example, my mom is like that too, and so what I've done is I've figured out *what motivates her* -- and when I say that, I mean: what she desires -- which is how she wants to feel. sometim5s it changes from moment to moment, and that's OK, because it's in the general pool of ways that she wants to feel -- and so then I can just work around it: if I suddenly feel like I want security/safety (for example), I know that's her and not me and so I can therefore ignore all of those types of thoughts (unless we're talking about her insecurities, then they're relevant).
for mom, it's perfectly OK for m5 to have her basically completely figured out, the problem of trying to do the same with you is obviously impossible because we don't talk enough that I can start getting into your head and figure out what motivates you (how you want to feel) -- and even if I did, you'd probably have serious issue with it, because you really like your privacy I noticed (or are scared of something -- not sure). with people that have those kinds of barriers up (one example that comes to mind is russ from snake-bros), I tend to keep my distance from them, because they have so many barriers up that they don't *want* me to figure them out -- and so because I respect their desire, I reflect them and their barriers back to them and keep my distance.
so, unfortunately, there's not much more that I can say other than I respect other people's barriers and boundaries, and so if it constantly looks like I'm trying to run away from you when we're talking, it's because I am. the amount of discomfort I feel is tremendous. also, I don't know how to actually have a real conversation with anyone because all of the thinks that I believe are happening, nobody else believes in. even right now, there are motors that are sounding in the background in responce to my thoughts -- but nobody will believe that there's a network that is actually broadcasting my thoughts. therefore, since this is a very real experience (mom, jaron, greg, and others can hear the motors/venting too -- though they haven't correlated them to m5 thoughts and feelings). how then can I actually talk about my experience if my experience is not valid?
	I'd like to take a moment to appreciate jaron for a moment, because he's also highly symbolic, (essentially the same as a venus-type), but his brain runs slow, so we can actually talk -- and also when I'm talking he's actually listening to me (cause his brain runs slow he has to pay attention), and not thinking about a whole bunch of other things; and actually, because he talks so slow, it gives *me* a chance to think about other things while he's talking.
	I'm able to think about something, and then come back to the conversation and then review the last few words he said, then go back to thiking my own thoughts -- which is probably how you and others are with me: words are so slow to communicate. if I could communicate conceptually (instead of with words), I could give you this entire letter in a flash -- however, the process of writing it out, allows me to make new connections that I hadn't before (like realising my reflectivity of russ).
OK, that's all for now... keni :)

### 2024-02-18 18:54 - the 2nd ray system

it ocurred to me when I was sitting upstairs eating lentils, that all of the conversations today were probably relevant: I had a long discussion with jaron about tuenti and the saturnian-system, along with my earlier letter, but also my thoughts on the flat-earth-idea.
the 2nd ray system that I want to make for the opposite/light side of the earth, probably already exists right now. so I'm sitting in front of your house (though the curtains are closed), and the picture/flash that came to me went something like this: througout time, my 2nd ray presence has been getting stronger and stronger. anyone with astral/spectral/relational perception has the ability to see it, and -- the most common way for most to see it is through sex magick. [this gives me the sense the thing people experienced before I was here, was 2nd ray relational perspective] then, finally in 2000, I arrive on earth (meaning, I'm no longer at a temporal distance) and now my 2nd ray perception becomes accessable through the spectral; the present saturnian/YHWH system is born.
	you know really crazy things happen all around me all the time. it's really not so evident nowadays cause I live in a pretty sane/symbolic lifestyle now. when I was younger (before 2k), we used to go to these pentecOstal church meetings, where tons of astral stuff is going on. I used to see astral before spain, and let me tell you I also saw crazy stuff happen (people being healed, etc.) that world is a world of magic, where what I believed (and I was pretty naive) would happen all the time. before 2k, I never experimented with drugs or sex or anything, so I never got to a power level where I could see the relational perspective. I still was pretty locked into the church's definition of "spiritual world" -- you know, what's funny is that even though I lost my pinecone (and my ability to see my imagination) in the brain thing (2k), I never saw anything like all those great prophets did. I've never seen a vision like that until later (after 2k) when I took drugs. I was always one of those "knower" types, because I just seemed to instantly *know* -- that is, I could *feel* (same thing as knowing) what the other person was saying or trying to convey. I always had this ability ever since I was very young: I just *knew* (through feeling) what everyone else was thinking by the way they felt. well, "prophecy" for me was no different: I just told them what I knew about them, and put the word "God" and "Holy Spirit" in there, because I associated that inspiration as coming from the "Holy Spirit" at that time. it was actually, in every sense of what christaians define the "Holy Spirit" to be -- cept, I just didn't lose the childhood capability entirely.
		what causes a child to lose that knowing through the sense of the emotions, is a symbolic system. I look at a bird, and I *know* the bird, and can *feel* the bird. I can feel how it flys, moves, thinks, what it's looking for, etc. until some jackass comes and tells me "oh, that's a sparrow" -- and once it's named and defined for me, I see the name of the bird instead of feeling the bird, how it moves and flys, and all of that. now, imagine that's the way that it works for humans too. I see someone and I get all of these crazy ideas about how awesome they are because I haven't been trained to see "all girls" such and such a way (the symbolic thing that overlays how they feel when I feel them), I've just become an adolescent -- which is where all of that comes from, because before I feel the world, and now I'm supposed to see the world now visually through the lens of society and social systems, when before I was fully integrated into the world because it was so visceral to me.
	the christian system taught me a lot about belief, which is what the *astral* (meaning, from the stars) system works. the way that I *believed*, is what I ended up *becoming* -- which was a huge issue for me in my adolescent years, because the astral system says that if I believe it, I can *be* it -- and here I am, going to church and there are these guys that are not being what I would want to *be*. I decided early on, that if I can *be* anything, then I decided that I wanted to take over the world with technology. I really wanted to learn to program because I could see computers as taking off. so I became it. for me, the way that these guys in church are (as adults) is *nothing* like how I would *be* if I knew the christian message. I figured, that these guys were definitely *not* who I wanted to be, so a sequence of events during really profound depression (also remember, I was going to university at this time) provided me with the ability to program. I learned how to type, and I learned how to program within a year of having got out. I was to become the thing that I beleived I could be.
what I believe has happened is that I have a quite powerful 2nd ray system, but because of my lack of pine-cone, I don't see it. instead, everyone else sees it, and entire industries and tech giants are utilising my 2nd ray system. the thing that they're most concerned about is me seeing images in my eyes. this has resulted in everything from shocks to mental institutions. it seems very important to all of these guys that I never see the astral system, because it's already so well inhabited.
that 2nd ray system, is the system that I, you, and everyone else sees. we're all living in a matrix that is inside of my head: they put one image into my eyes, and another image into other people's eyes -- and since we're all together inside of my head, it looks like we're in the same world. we are in fact, in the same world (or simulation) and that is a reflection of how I basically *believe* the universe works (LOA). it doesn't have to be that way (ie, obey my laws/beliefs about attraction), and I think one of the new really hot things nowadays is to create an alternate spectral implementation, which allows for any other astral implementation that is desired: just provide a new temporal/symbolic system (ie spaceships come after toasters), and get enough people to believe in it, and it'll be a self-equalising system (equal amounts of the good/just/right binaries). in general, all new forms of experience will be built in these spectral systems. it's gonna be cool.
anyway,-- so I'm here right now in the system with everyone else, but I'll eventually leave. after that, it is what it is.
	[wow so, that's a really funny way to look at it] what I'm really saying essentially is that I'm preparing my after-life to be living in the flat-earth-idea, where what I'm expireincing is the astral system, of which the universe is a reflection. [in religious narrative sence, that's kinda a funny way way to think about writing the "afterlife narrative": some people make thousands of virgins, but I decided I wanted to follow my pen-rose dreams and go full flat-earth with *no astral perception*. beat that mohammad :)] in the end, I think it's actually the world most in which I want to be, and it's funny that it sorta drags everyone right along with me into it, too.

#### 2024-02-18 23:38 - ready player one 

check all of the narrative conditions. genetics is good for ensuring I am capable of absorbing all frequencies (positionally found as a length of sequence on the pen-rose), but that doesn't mean all of the *conditions*. what I mean is, sure I can feel the worst trepidation, but if I'm in a really nice setting (like a beach or something), that feeling of fear no longer bothers me cause the good conditions are so much louder.

### 2024-02-18 23:31 - going straight-edge

you're probably right about needing to go straight-edge: I realised that I used a drug to get my brain to go at faster speeds, which means I'm a bit of an actor. I don't want to be one though, so it's going to be my intention to actually go straight-edge, that way I can be at this speed all the time, without needing the drug (or whatever condition).

#### 2024-02-19 22:44 - thoughts

I've been thinking a lot about this today, and if I actually go straight-edge, then I'm 100% sure that manifestations will start happening. drug use has been an ongoing "problem" for me -- really ever since I moved to spain. a year before I moved to spain I didn't drink or smoke. then for about a year, when I was in essembly office before we left for spain, I started drinking heavily with zaryn and smoking with adam. at that time essembly was a political social network that was gaining traction pretty quickly, and was certainly the first project that put me on the radar for the saturnian-system. before I showed up, the page was pretty boring and uninteresting, but by the time we left, it had a full system where people could get to know each other based on their ideological proximity. before I moved to the office and living with adam on the beach, I was living in glendora in a room in this guy's house (robert). anyway, after I managed to do something akin to an epic rewrite of the entire website (well beyond what I was tasked with doing) zaryn "took me under his wing" and brought me to the office, "so that I could work more" -- which I actually did a lot less of. I was far more productive in robert's modest little bedroom than I was in the office, and that was mainly due to substance abuse. what happened is, I finally saw the light of the website, and realised I had managed to get hired by a website that was *exactly* the one that I wanted to create -- cept it was politically motivated, and not socially motivated (I wanted to find others that are ideologically similar to myself), so I started really reworking the website so it could actually have all of the features that I wanted to use for a social network. (I planned on using the ideological proximity system in tuenti, but I got bogged down with chat and session daemon, so I never got to implement the ideological system in tuenti). I also planned on using the same system for "rondevu" -- a website for hanging out with other people with ideological similarity as well... none of those things ever materialised because there is a very strong opposition in the saturnian-system of allowing people to find other people that they actually *like*
	other people to complain with or share insecurities and deficiencies, sure -- but no good influences, because that causes problems. in fact, if you look throughout history, you'll notice that all power structures are very strongly against anyone ever meeting in large groups (covid, for example). collaboration is subversive, so they prefer techcrunch style "disruptive" apps for getting together (like grindr/tinder), instead of actually real collaboration. even google has discontinued all collaborative products, and the best collaborative system right now (zoom) has all of the access controls to ensure that it's more of a top-down system than a "grassroots" bottom-up system.
anyway that was the beginning of a long history of substance abuse for me, and it has seriously hurt my productivity, but most importantly it has kept me *unfocused*.
	I find it very difficult to talk about drugs when I see you in person, so I'd like to take a moment to talk about how drugs work (for me at least), because understanding how they work is key to understanding the brain and consciousness.
		if you only see one perspective all of your life, you may assume that the things you're looking at are flat. in order to see the extra dimension, you'll need to look from a different perspective. 
	when I am stoned (especially with weed), I cannot think thoughts very quickly. the drug forces me to ruminate on the idea a bit more than usual. that style of thinking is most similar to thoughts of appreciation, or to savour the feeling of the moment/thought for longer than normal. when that happens, more details are noticed.
	to explain this as a simple, imagine you're good at speed-reading, and you're able to essentially look at a paragraph at a time and sorta get the gist of what it's saying. that works really great for regularly structured (conforming) sentences and ideas. that style of reading simply is not possible with shakespere, for example, and so then you're forced to sequentially parse each word to figure out what is happening. the mode that the brain is in, when reading shakspere is very similar to how it's like being stoned. the major difference however is that shakespere requires focus, and the stone is causing me to be unfocused.
	now, to further the example, we look around us all of the time and receive a very large amount of data input. the brain cannot process all of that data, so what it's good at doing is recognising things that it's experineced (seen/felt/touched/etc) before, and it quickly says, "oh that's a ... no danger. everything's fine" and moves on to the next thing. if you have a messy desk or house for example, you'll notice that the brain is capable of filtering out all of the mess to such a point (for me at least), that it no longer even sees the mess. those things in the mess are categorized and quantified already to be completely uninteresting. well, while stoned, it's often the case that when looking at something on my my desk, instead of not seeing it as I normally do, instead, I think a lot longer about that thing.
	for example, I have a rock on my desk that I picked up from the field. it has a texture to it that is incredibly cool. it looks almost volcanic, but I know that I"m in a desert and there's nothing but clay here, that rock is burt and molten clay that's been solidified into that cool texture and shape. I actaully have two different rocks that are like that, and they're quite interesting in how different they are from each other. both experienced extremely high heat, but one has bubbles in it, and wthe other has ridges. they're both found within less than a few miles of each other. now, even though I like the rocks, normally, I don't even see their cool texture or even see the rock. they're just a part of the mess on my desk. by seeing those cool things as just rocks, I'm allowed to focus on writing and stuff like I'm doing now.
	in resume: fast thoughts happen when focused because lots and lots of information is filtered out, but slow thoughts (symbolic analysis) are forced when the brain thinks longer on an item than just the quick label. try it for yourself: pick something interesting; physical object or idea, and just focus on the thing (meditate) on the thing/idea for a longer period of time than it takes to just symbolically define it ("that's a sparrow") -- and you'll notice that you start to gain a kind of sympathy for the object: you become sympathetic to it, and it starts to reveal itself to you. that's cosciously induced 4th ray perception right there. no need for sex magick: just focus on the idea and it shows itself.
for the last 18y now (started when I was 22yo) I've been experiencing continual defocusing; which has taught me a lot, by causing my to think about things for longer than I "should" (cause normally the narrative tells me what it is so I don't need to think about it), BUT I like being unfocused. I have no intention *whatsoever* of getting focused, because that would mean that I start to do things like fly and move objects with my mind, and things like that. nobody wants that -- and the people who do, are the same ones that "need a manifestation" (or sign and wonder) in order to *believe*. I'm not one of those people. that's a symbolic thing that says, "OK, I've seen it, so it's proven and it's real". I'm all about attraction, so for me, the *feeling* is all I need. I look at the megalithic stuff like the great pyramid and say, "yep I could do that" -- and pretty easily too, if I started to gain focus again.
	it's easy: I just want to see the pyramid that I want to make, and it appears in my eyes. then, I figure out its properties, and start building it. same as tesla with his motors, but I've streamlined the creation process by simply desiring it, instead of trying to figure out its dimensions and attributes symbolically. I'm always able to instantly see the thing, so for me the implementation is the difficult part. for melting rocks and stuff, I need to either start doing a lot of gay sex, and pump up the energy that way, or convince nosebook to stop doing what they're doing. als, even if I could see the image in my eyes, the implementation would be completely against my own beliefs, as well. imagine I decided I wanted to build a tower of stone (or a pyramid), so that I could use that energy to fly and shoot fire and stuff -- well then, I've become the thing that I hate: conditional/symbolic (all conditions start with a comparison). instead, I prefer to *attract* the things I want to experience, not emit them out there conditionally (like the pyramid) or unconditionally (like the sun). neither of those is something you will *ever* see me do, even though I know I can -- though sometimes it's happened by accident, cause I wasn't focused.
the other difficulty that I have with being focused like that, is that I start to get really symbolic, and everything starts to have to conform to the way that I see reality. greg is constantly on my case (cause he's this way too), about trying to make the entire world a reflection of myself. I want things to operate the way that I see them and understand them to be. that perspective is the 2nd ray perspective, and I'm *strongly* avoiding it. I don't want to start dictating how others should see their reality and stuff like that, cause if I start getting focused, things start going my way, and there's nothing the saturnian-system can do to stop it. they've been keeping me unfocused this whole time because they don't want me to overthrow their structure and narrative. I happen to like it when I see others understanding and enjoying life (for me, I have to understand it to appreciate it), and a world filled with those kinds of people is *REALLY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL*.
I haven't made my decision yet, but what I'm thinking about doing is going straight-edge and saying f-you to the world (sucks to be you all), working on my genetics idea, and actually becoming black (meaning fully absorbative). then, once they've got their system in place, I'll just peace out and start over in the new system (new challenge). are you sure you want to start the "end times"? personally, I prefer to stay unfocused, and just ride it out, attracting for what I really want (flat-earth-idea and going blind/sensless to rebuild my entire form of perception using only-attraction), cause it'll eventually come to me. I don't really need to push it, and try to make anything happen. I happen to like drugs, and drugs allow me to be 1st ray. anything with other people (projects, sex, etc) is all 2nd ray, and so therefore becomes a symbolic system, because I have to communicate with syntax. I *know* it's possible to do everything the symbolic system does using only-attraction (like receiving the pyramid I want to make, with a small amount of focus), and I know it's possible to do everything from programming to math problems (or solving encryption puzzles) also using only-attraction. it really is superior, and I don't want to force myself on anyone in order to get it; *it can just come to me*.
	
### 2024-03-11 09:53 - refelctors in action

hi again, so I'm on day 2 I think of being straight-edge, and things are still quite intense, not because I'm straight-edge, but still from the residual energy from sun-watching during my interaction with big-truck-guy. I learned a lot during that experience, and I'm actually thinking of doing more sun-watching because it's so effective in "bringing things to a head" (as mom says). anyway, I wanted to talk about reflectors again, and it's sort of a followup to [what I wrote to sarah](/dear-sarah.md#2024-03-09-0324---reflectors-is-rosalind-mars-or-vulcan).
yesterday was funny because I've been wanting to be spending my time at night working on some programming. the reason why is because nights are *very different* than the day, now that I'm so much more solar in my vibraton (thanks to the sun-watching). yesterday I woke up and (and now no longer stoned/unfocused) I decided to write out my critisisms of 23andme and (I can't remember when) added a few thoughts about how the whole world is being controlled by these "aryan white guys" (mars) (which posited was the guy that lives on #11 -- he projects/amplifies sound so much that I can hear the basketball bouncing through art's thick shrubbery as if the ball were right next to me). my assertion that he's just another one of these aryan mars types (top in command is comes from the installation in antarctica and mars) seemed to cause quite an upset, and because he's an emitter and somewhat reflective like greg, I feel his symbolic projection the way he does (for example, remember when I claimed that there was a network, while talking with you and melissa? during that time I felt VERY STRONGLY your/melissas/the-network's symbolic anger being projected at me, which is why I was vibrating so much, out of breath, and could hardly stand up). well, same thing with him yesterday. usually I run away or try to avoid the situation, but yesterday I decided to amplify it instead (I'll continue this procedure) by going and sitting in the shed and letting his feelings turn to thoughts, pictures, and actions. then, I went and stood in the sun a bit and continued to amplify it (same as with big-truck-guy).
	what's happening there is that when I start reflecting the sun (2nd-ray energy), I get onto the same frequency (inside the same medium) as them, and so now I feel very strongly the symbolic output of what they're projecting. again, as a reference, notice how when we (you, me, and melissa) were talking, we were standing in the sun? notice how that effect is much much stronger in the sun, yet doesn't really happen at all during the night? anyway, when I get on their frequency, I'm now retransmitting/emitting their own anger and symbolic awful feeling back to them, which means we're now in a sort of swordfighting dual, where they think I'm challenging their emissive output and have to prove their dominance (shakespere makes fun of these emitters having to prove their dominance in a hilarious way in MWOW in the sword fight with dr-caius). I think it's absolutely hilarious, even thtough (because I'm reflecting them), I probably look very upset and pissed off (that's them, not m5 -- I feel fine on the inside, and am just letting my body act out their projected feeling).
now, the ability for me to allow my body to act out another person's projected/reflected feeling is quite an interesting one. I had a long monologue last night about it talking about my sexual experiences in spain, which reminded me to write this when I woke up.
a long time ago (2018?), I was still trying to use my programming as a way to feel good, and one of the things I've wanted to do is to make a lot of really simple games. I noticed this one streamer (david/dog) was playing this game called "set", and I thought it was a great simple little game to copy,-- and also at that time, I could also feel eva very strongly.
	my estimation is that paul started out as a strong emitter (mercury in perception), and so because the Y isn't in a suitable environment (cause energy is too high), it gets discarded, so eva feels to me like an XX female (one of the 7th-ray strumpets like gertrude that shakespere isn't too fond of), which means that she's going to be a pretty good reflector (same as andrea).
so, when I set out to make the set-game, I decided I was going to make it for her and to show it to her (same as I did with booble-bobble for andrea) -- and probably because we were so nearby (across the street) and also because she was still a virgin, the reflection was quite good -- and the project really flowed quite well. I was able to program the significant portion of the game in 2 days (I think), and it was really quite a pleasurable experience for me. I really enjoyed it and wanted to make her my muse for making other games.
	I've worked with a lot of people over the years, and some people really stand out, as being people that things have really flowed with. those people I've come to figure out were all XX males. for example, felix (certainly an XX male) asked me to build a thing for coca-cola, and because I reflect him, I could turn his feeling/desire into reality in a very short period of time. same with a guy I used to work with before I went to spain (keith). for these guys, that reflective nature of mine really makes things easy. now, on the opposite side of things, I've worked for jupiter types (zaryn,augusto), saturnian types (marcos) and I've worked for mercury types (dani/daniel/jori?) and things do not flow at all the same way for either of those; though, conversely, I noticed that dani could get that flow when he made things for me, probably because I reflected his own idea back to him well enough that he could see it clearly. dani loved making things for me, and I loved seeing what he could make. turns out, the "principality" of the project makes a lot of difference for me.
anyway, due to my own instability at the time, I couldn't maintain using eva as my muse, and obviously her energy has changed quite a bit since then (she now carries the energy of other guys, an effect I also noticed with andrea) -- which is quite unfortunate. I was going to talk about you and allie, but it doesn't fit the reflectors setup now, so I'll leave it here. bye!

### 2024-04-29 04:21 - pulling weeds

yesterday, I had a strange set of events, which made me cancel my job of pulling weeds: I woke up and made my way out to the shed to try and wake up (like I did the day previous, cause it worked so well), but this time greg was sunbathing next to his shed, and becasuse of the way the energy follows along the fence he doesn't want me to get rid of, and is focused into the shed by the wheelbarrod and stump that he also insists on having there, his energy (especially when he's sunbathing in that spot) makes its way into the shed where I was sitting down to try and wake up. the shed that I sit in, is kind of an amplifier to my own thought energy because it's basically just a steel frame around m5 (kinda like a partial faraday cage). anyway, because I'm a really good reflector, I absorb his energy and retransmit it; but his energy doesn't feel very good at all. I think he left eventually (he took off in his car), and I could feel when he left cause his energy stopped getting amplified and started to amplify my own thoughts again (hard to explain this effect, honestly). anyway during the time where I was amplifying his energy, all kinds of terrible ideas that don't feel good (which would make me the manifestation of his perception) would come into my head, like breaking things, damaging his car, destroying parts of his shed, etc. those thoughts ([like I explained to melissa](/dear-melissa.md#2024-04-28-0547---do-the-right-thing-and-blame-yourself)) I know are not me, but are a reflection of the person's energy that I'm in (greg's), and they, like him *don't feel good*, so I don't usually do them (times in the past, I have), so nowadays, because I know I'm not going to actually do the things that feel bad to me, I just let them continue to amplify (sorta like what I did with zaryn reflecting him and telling everyone I was a big deal), *because I know that's not me*. anyway, during this time, and especially after greg went away, I had a strong realisation that I don't want to go back and pull your weeds -- and the reason is simple: if I start doing things that don't feel good to me, then I'll start performing some of those things that are a reflection of greg. it's either one or the other for me; I'm either doing things that don't feel good (like destroying gregs car and pulling your weeds), or I'm simply passing on activity and letting it go (not destroying greg's car, and not pulling your weeds). I'm either one or the other (as default programming), and I don't feel safe trying to make exceptions: OK, I'll pull remi's weeds (which doesn't feel good -- why? I'm not sure) but this other thing that really doesn't feel good, I'm going to not do that thing either. it doesn't make sense to me, because since 2017 when I got back here, the dominant thing that I've learned this entire time, is that *I want to feel good* more than I want to manifest the bad-feeling that I feel so strongly as a reflection of the person that's focused on me. you remember the conversation that we had with the neighbour melissa (house #19) and while you were telling me the network didn't exist and that my entire experience isn't valid? well during that tim5 I had flashes of seriously hurting both of you -- but again, that's a reflection (of probably melissa), and so I didn't perform the action. I just stood there vibrating very uncomfortably -- well, the reason why I didn't actually hit you guys (even though I felt like it), was because I prefer to feel good more than I want to feel bad. I perform action based on how I feel, not on what some set of rules which I'm supposed to follow. my brain isn't quick enough to follow rules, because the feeling (like a reaction to an insect biting you) puts m5 into action, *instantly*. the only way to control myself (and not break things or whatever) when I feel bad, is to *want to feel good, more*.
now, to explain why pulling your weeds (and to some extent sesily's as well), it goes something like this: weeds are a vegetable manifestation of the energy that we have going on. if we feel good, then wild flowers and nice things show up (like the stuff that would pop up near to where I was star-watching), and if we feel irritation, then thorns and thistles will show up (which are irritating), others are profuse and annoying, etc. I can feel the energy of the people who manifested those weeds when I pull them, and so as I pull the weeds, I'm sorta like going around and collecting the essence of those people, and manifesting their irritations and stuff like that. because I pulled out the manifestation of their irritation or their good-feeling (or whatever concept they have going on), then I now become the manifestation of that concept, instead of the weed; so, if the weeds are a manifestation of their irritation/annoyance, then I will become their irritation/annoyance.
	a few examples of this: one of the guys that was at sesily's place (he had a mexican boyfriend with really nice hair), had a daughter that would come over from time to time. she seemed pretty interested in me, and I could feel her pretty strongly (in fact, I could feel everyone there really strongly, which is why I had to stop), and we'd communicate telepathically and stuff -- but I didn't really understand what that exactly was about, but I noticed that her mom would come around, and they'd have arguments or something (there was conflict, which is what I think his weeds were a manifestation of), and so somehow, I think my interaction with the girl reignited and made me the centre of her mother and father's conflict. sesily then wanted me to move in in the upper room there, and I simply had to decline. I need to be close to earth to dissipate the energy (which is why I prefer to sleep on the ground), or else have another way of dissipating it, and also every time that I would place myself into the future of that alternate trajectory, it felt to me if I were to spend a lot of time above the ground (2nd-floor, not 7th floor, like in tuenti), that energy starts to expand around the city, and pueblo as a whole will have to get used to my energy and what it feels like for me to program, or else conflict starts to take over. I didn't want that, and I also didn't want to further cause difficulties for the guy and his wife, or try and mess up the thing with the girl... just so much conflict, I didn't think it would work out -- so fortunately, another reflective event allowed me to relieve myself of the situation: sesily wanted some weeds gone (they were the white flowers ones growing next to the house of the woman that I would greet (she too, like allie felt like a female vulcan), and though I knew they were a reflection of her and how she feels (I think they grow from the energy that nosebook puts out when vulcans are enjoying certain female-related content)), and so I was a reflection of sesily here: I need to either perform a permanent solution (rototill the place), or I want to find a way to let the weeds grow and look nice (find a way to make it work). I couldn't come to an agreement with sesily, so I knew it was my time to stop. in the same way, greg sunbathing was the trigger that I knew I had to stop pulling your weeds.
	another example, is that greg has very specific weeds that grow only around his sheds (he has two) -- and I don't see those weeds growing anywhere else on this street than right next to his sheds -- and when I pick those weeds, it's almost always a certainty that those weeds cause me to produce a lot of really little annoyances that are difficult to get rid of (some weeds are easy to pull, and others snap off at the stem, and so require some extra digging). well those weeds in the years previous required extra digging and work to pull out, but this year, they're pulling much easier without snapping, so they're minor annoyances (that usually manifest with me and jaron, but probably others) but now they're getting easier to resolve and get rid of. either way, when I pull his weeds, I collect that essence and then become that for him. one may wonder why I don't just leave all of the weeds around his shed for him to pull, and tell him to do that -- well, I don't tell people what to do, and I'm not going to start telling him, plus, it's not really all that much work for me. they're often mixed in with others and so it's just not really that big of a deal for me to get those as well. then inevitably when I manifest his annoyance in place of the weed, I'm confident that it's easy enough to figure out the annyance and get rid of it. it's not really that big of a deal for me -- so whatever.
now, I'd like to comment for a moment about the weeds at your house: I put them roughly into three zones: on the driveway and the side yard, there are a whole mix of weeds that have the feeling of the annoyances of john, paul, and eva -- and eva and paul have a very strange energetic connection that I haven't fully figured out. you manifest your weeds mainly in the back near the kitchen where there are those big wheat grass ones and the mint, which reflect you because they smell nice, and they're impossible to get rid of, but the wheat grass ones grow really big and gnarley, and have quite a good feel to them when pulling them out (the also appear in allie's side yard too but not quite as big). the feel I get from those ones are these little tiny problems that grow into large honkers, which then upon removal, feel so good to get rid of because they've grown so large and ugly (sometimes they take extra effort to get rid of, too). finally, the side yard next to the kitchen is where most of allie's energy is focused. the white flowered vines that grow so commonly around the vulcans are present, but they're mixed in with a whole bunch of really strange ones -- there are the wheat grass in smaller portions that I find similar of you, but they're never really big, a bunch of these tiny grasses that never grow any bigger than an inch or so, and sometimes these incredible thistles grow, which have quite a pungent odour to them. under the white flowers there's a lot of unwanted stuff mixed in there (and I think that's cause she doesn't understand how to shape her perception, like she could).
anyway, the reason why I said I could pull your weeds, is because now that I'm in my body all of the time, when I'm pulling them here, I just feel my body and enjoy the movement of it, and seening the progress and stuff like that. it's a different (very manual sense of pleasure, and I come away feeling refreshed and pretty good). I figure, if I can do the same thing at your house, then it's not really all that much of a problem for me. yesterday I came over to start in on it because our yard is a complete mudpit, and so impossible to do any real work, so I can do yours, I thought. now, as I'm pulling the weeds in the front driveway yesterday, I'm noticing that the experience is quite a bit different than it is at my house: I get out of my body and go into my head (cause even your house is largely defocusing, because of the way yours and paul's energy is), which also happens here at my house, but the quality of my thoughts is a bit different: here, when I get into my head, I'm often noticing processes and making realisations, but at your house, I'm paying attention to actions, what people are doing, what they're saying, how they're responding -- and all of this stuff is all *symbolic* -- cause I'm focused outside of myself. for example, when eva's friend was going to pick up allie (I think), I was able to completely forget that eva's friend's mother(?) was in the car and could keep focused on my body. so, it is possible, to stay in my body, but I found myself extremely defocused and paying a lot of attention to things outside of me. then, when I got home, I think jaron was taking a shower, so my staying up to get dinner for him was in vain, and asked greg to do it and went to sleep. I woke up and [wrote to my sister](/dear-melissa.md), which was a reflection of the essence that I'd collected in front of eva's window (melissa and eva are kinda similar in vibration) was and went about my day, but I kept noticing the feeling of paul popping up all around me. his feeling is very saturnian (a feeling I started to notice around marcos), and it's a feeling that I don't really like. I tend to avoid it at this point, because I really don't want to do the tit-for-tat 1-up-man-ship sort of thing. it's just not a feeling that I want to feel.
one of the things that I concluded, is that in order to pull weeds at your house, I'd need to probably go back to doing drugs again, so I'm defocused enough that I'm focused on whatever's in my head and around me again, that I'm not so sensitive to how *I* feel anymore. you know, in times past, I've eaten weed and mushrooms while working on your weeds, and it's a strange experience for me -- and getting that defocused, I'm now hyper-aware of how so many things feel (the weeds, your family, the stones, everything) and it starts to become too much to handle, and can't think about anything productive while I'm at your house. when I'm by myself on drugs, I like to figure things out, and make *realisations* about what's happening, and how things work -- but I don't do that as often at your house, and when I do, it seems there's a kind of blowback that comes with it (defocusing and taking a step back is actually one of the best ways to figure something out), so it's really strange to me how stagnated your house is in perception -- like, it really resists to make any realisations, and doesn't want to see anything other than what's immediately in front of them -- which for me is exactly opposite: for me, what's immediately in front of me, *is how I feel*, which is where I have that constant feeling of new and exciting discoveries (like a child). I realised that just isn't the way that I want to feel, or to perceive. sure, our house has a whole lot of problems, but I really strongly prefer 2nd-ray perception over 4th-ray perception. I could accomplish 2nd-ray perception at your house yesterday, and various times on drugs, but like I said it comes with blowback. I just don't want to get involved with that. my desire to perceive lays in a completely different space, than the one you're living in.

### 2024-04-30 11:49 - 2nd-ray perception & thinking out loud

hey so, the reason why I write is because I live in a world that doesn't really have any words; it's basically just mostly feelings, and those feelings give me a general idea of what my environment and people around me are like. the thing about that form of perception (which I believe allie is similar), is that *I* (kenny, my brain) don't really know exactly what those feelings *mean* -- and the reason for that is because I haven't yet translated them into symbolic form (symbolic just means conditions, states and actions: if this, then that, do this while that, etc.). so, what I and many other people do to figure out how they feel, is to talk it out. I don't really have many people I can talk to about the things that I believe, and many others don't -- so I write -- because here, nobody can tell me what I believe is wrong or bad, or a disorder or anything like that. I'm learning about what my own feelings are, by translating them into symbolic form. this capacity is a notably vulcan thing to do, and it's right there in the designation (-5+) -- which just means input and output concepts/emotions/feelings, and then translate/output them to the opposite side (3) which is symbol (words, actions, conditions, matter, logic, etc). [when I was talking to my syster](/dear-melissa.md#2024-04-28-0319---comment-yesterday-on-reflectivity-of-women), I suggested to her that she talk to herself and get to know how she is when there are less external influences, *because that's important*. for example, when I was growing up, I didn't have a lot of influences, and so I just thought that it was normal to behave like chris, my mom, or dad, or whatever -- because I reflected them, and so therefore didn't really know myself too well. later on in spain, after a crash and burn, I spent a lot of time by myself (often times on drugs), and I started to figure out that I feel like other people do, because when I would change who I was hanging around with, the way I felt (and so therefore the words and actions that I used, which were mimicing/reflective of them), also changed.
now, turning those feelings/concepts into words and actions is incredibly important, *but it's only the first stage*. after that, what I noticed is that I could start to recognise certain feelings that people had -- like for example, people who are lying and making excuses often times feel similar to a person that's on the defencive. they're literally tryinyg to explain away something that they want to hide with a bogus explanation. a person who's actually trying to be real and give a real answer feels a lot more genuine and real. the difference between the way that a person feels when they talk to me (and I often reflect back) -- so if they're pushing hard for me to believe their bogus explanation, then I can either just believe them (cause I don't want to reflect them back and tell them that I don't believe them), or I can just go with the flow and sort it out later in my own head, figuring out what it is that doesn't feel right about their explanation. I usually go with the latter there, because when I'm talking to someone that is blowing smoke, they're usually not in a mindset that wants to help me to process (into symbol) what it is that feels bogus about their explanation. I often times need to remove myself from their presence (so I stop feeling like them), and figure it out on my own; so usually when someone is clearly telling me lies, I often times don't figure out the lies until much later. now, the way that I figure out what it is that that's bogus about their explanation, is to *relate* one feeling to antoher. for example, the other day, greg told me that the fence that to the side of his shed was cause they had a vineyard in the back yard. I knew it was bogus at the time, cause I could feel it, but I just said "uhuh" and moved on. he also told me that there was a big tree in in the back yard -- whell, it's either a big tree or a vineyard, and the special soil necessary to have a vineyard isn't present -- and there are a ton of big roots. it's certain that if there actually was a vineyard there, nothing was growing, because the clay soil just isn't good enough for that. greg comes up with all kinds of bogus excuses, so he's a great one to learn from.
now, the actual process of figuring out what's bogus about something I felt, or whatever, is the 2nd-ray form of perception. greg has 2nd-ray form of perception in the output form (he relates ideas to me, and says that this is the (symbolic) reason for them), which is really good for self-delusion, and trying to build up a narrative -- and in fact, that's what nearly all of what science and the news is about: bogus explanations designed to explain something. they're often times circular in nature, (there were giants during the ice age, cause there was also megafauna, so everything was bigger), but they often times fail to explain the *why* aspect of it; in fact "why" is the most difficult question for them to often times answer, because to answer the "why", one needs to have all of the concepts relating in a way that actually works (so for example, *why* were things bigger, needs a good explanation of what determines the size of something in DNA -- which will need probably an explanation of wavelengths and things like that). I don't push out how ideas relate like greg does until I've figured out what the feeling is about, because it's so prone to failure. I *feel* the concept and how it relates to anther concept, and that relation often times has a recognisable feel to it: for example, when I feel how DNA can have different sizes, that feels similar in concept to how pnumatic pistons work -- which is close, but not exactly the same -- because then I have to give an explanation of where the pressure (which is causing the piston to move) is coming from, and what is it exerting its pressure on. so for me an explanation is always going to be a combination of similies, which eventually come together to give me a bigger picture.
	quantum mechanics is sorta like that, actually: they took one simile, and just kept going with it, not realising that it's only similar, and not the thing itself. it never occurs to them that the particle and the wave are the same thing, just in different forms of perception (inside-out vs outside-in). the problem with similies and analogies is that they break down because they don't have every single aspect. water in a pipe describes the flow of electric current only up to a certain amount -- and then after that it doesn't completely work. everything is like that, which is why I try and use many different similies tto relate something. so, for example, just the soil and the big tree isn't enough to conclusively give me a solid big-picture of what the back yard used to look like, I need to look at other things, like the broken sprinkler sytem, to realise there was probably a lawn at some point -- which at that point, I now find it ~100% certain that there wasn't a vineyard growing on top of the lawn with a big tree.
	a quick commentary on that actually, cause the saturnian-system falls prey to this factor all the time: when looking at the surface of something (like the earth or some other thing in time, or the surface of someone's skin), there's a lot of vibrating hydrogen that's kinda hanging out on the surface there; these are all concepts which all have a certain *feel* to them -- and what the saturnian-system does is to take clumps of these concepts and turn them into symbol *individually*, which seems nice, because let's say I'm looking at a person, and they have concepts of goodness and generosity that's vibrating on their surface, which gives them the appearance of being good and generous, *which is true*, but it's not the whole story. there are often times other things that are vibrating around there too, and so because the mind wants to indentify all of the parts, they see the individual aspects that are *resonant to them* (ie, the *recognisable* things that they like or dislike), and turn those into something visible/tangible. what's going on here is the 2nd-ray aspect of recognition (re-cognition: the abiltiy to notice one thing is experienced the same as another experience). I can only recognise things that I've experienced, and I can only see those things I've experencied in what I'm looking at. there's an entire unseen world of things that are there, but they're not recognised, because they haven't been experienced. for example, if I travel back in time and look at shakespere, what I see are the conepts of then, but they're recognised by my experience leading up to now (and so therefore, my recognition of them will be skewed). this (only seeing what I can recognise) difficulty is so prevalent in science, history, and technology, we're unable to see the big-picture of what's happening, because when we turn the conceptual simile into symbolic form, we think it *is that thing* (when it's just a simile).
all things are relative one to another, and no thing/idea/concept/symbol can ever perfectly describe another (seems obvious, right?) because otherwise it'd be the thing itself.

### 2024-04-30 14:48 - two ways to look at the same thing

in the previous entry, I talked about how (especially in quantum mechanics), they're looking at something and they see it as two separate things, but it's the same thing from a different perspective. one such example of this is the difference between concepts and symbol: let's take an example: I look at myself (or someone else) and say, "when X, then I do Y" -- "when they call me stupid, I hit them" -- now, that's the symbolic part of the thing; I'm looking at it from the outside-in perspective, cause there's distance between me and what I'm looking at (myself) while I make the analysis. now, I step into my body and I'm in a situation where someone calls me stupid, and I just hit them. (like hitting the brake when driving a car) I didn't even think about what I was doing at all and analyse it symbolically, but just reacted, according to the symbolic system that I already had in place (when someone calls me stupid, I hit them). it's the same thing, but the reaction is from the inside-out perspective, and the analysis was from the outside-in perspective. science calls the emotional/conceptual/reaction technique the "fast brain" because you don't need to think about it to create the feeling (hydrogen) necessary to get the synapse to fire and move the muscles; the symbolic technique is the "slow brain" because you have to analyse what's happening and pay extra attention to all of of the observed details. shakespere uses this technique extensively, because when *reading* the plays, there are so many things going on (wrong spelling, character alignments, and different sensations) that are passed astrally through the text, that it forces the person to pay attention and use the "slow brain" instead. because of that, it's a very different experience *reading* the playes (slow brain), instead of *watching* the plays (fast brain). each production of shakespere is a reflection of the producer (and actors) of that play, and encodes their form of perception into the production, in the way that the lines are delivered, settings, actors, costumes, etc. they give the play (which can be taken so many different ways, like an analysis), a simple facade in which we can *look at* and see it through the concept of the producers. the brain doesn't need to think about all of the options, and make an analysis, but instead just gets *fed* the information without needing to think. this is also the difference between television and reading a book -- or in mcluhan's terminology: the difference between hot (fast brain) and cold (slob brain) media. it's all the same.

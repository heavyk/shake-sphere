### 2024-02-18 11:51 - talking to you is hard

hi, I didn't think I'd ever write to you directly, but I'm going to try it. this morning I woke up thinking about what I wrote to sarah about raquel and my mishap with her sister.
	obviously, there's no easy way for me to wiggle out of that situation, and trying to explain that it's a movie quote doesn't help at all, so I just take the blame (earlier that day I heard this really awesome song in the t-mobile store where the guy was smoking weed, and I haven't felt stoned like that since I was really young, so it was nice to hear that song and feel the stone from his perspective). anyway, since there's no way I can make that situation better with words, I decided simply not to explain myself to raquel or her sister and just go with it. that was probably a bad choice on my part to make because communication always helps.
right after noting that I opted to not communicate with raquel, I started to think about you (notice how the subjects are related?)	about how difficult it is for me tto talk to you. I went to bed thinking about how I'll probably go walk to nuvue (the weed store) again later today, which is what reminded m5 of it, because last time, you caught m5 on the way, and multiple times claimed that I was going "straight-edge" -- which I found really strange because I was walking to the weed store. sure, I'm not nearly as vice-ish as I used to be, but still I wouldn't consider myself even close to straight-edge, one bit. I really enjoy using drugs to see outside of the culturally-mandated form of interacton that we're supposed to adhere to. I would have told you that in the moment, but the reality is, I simply could not.

because it's so difficult for me to think about what I want to talk about when I'm around these venus-type (highly symbolic) females, I thought maybe I would write a letter:

hi remi,
it is very difficult to talk to you because your brain goes so much faster than mine does, and during the interaction I'm constantly getting bombarded with my and your feeling reactions to thoughts you're thinking. for me to be able to communicate effectively, I need to *feel* the concept that I'm trying to convey (which is why I don't look people in the eyes, because I then *really* start to feel them, instead of myself). so, while I'm talking, you're thinking about all kinds of other stuff, which I feel as (my own) worry about what *I* look like, what I'm talking about, if I'm boring her with my words, etc. -- which means you're worried about what you look like, and am thinking that I'm taking too long to say nothing -- which btw, is because I can't feel my response yet, and am trying to generate my own feeling with my words so I can actually *feel* and build my response.
I've obviously interacted with many venus-types in my life before, so I usually try to interact with them only on a material level (what I'm doing, where I'm going, etc) cause anything further is impossible, essentially until I've figured the other person out. for example, my mom is like that too, and so what I've done is I've figured out *what motivates her* -- and when I say that, I mean: what she desires -- which is how she wants to feel. sometim5s it changes from moment to moment, and that's OK, because it's in the general pool of ways that she wants to feel -- and so then I can just work around it: if I suddenly feel like I want security/safety (for example), I know that's her and not me and so I can therefore ignore all of those types of thoughts (unless we're talking about her insecurities, then they're relevant).
for mom, it's perfectly OK for m5 to have her basically completely figured out, the problem of trying to do the same with you is obviously impossible because we don't talk enough that I can start getting into your head and figure out what motivates you (how you want to feel) -- and even if I did, you'd probably have serious issue with it, because you really like your privacy I noticed (or are scared of something -- not sure). with people that have those kinds of barriers up (one example that comes to mind is russ from snake-bros), I tend to keep my distance from them, because they have so many barriers up that they don't *want* me to figure them out -- and so because I respect their desire, I reflect them and their barriers back to them and keep my distance.
so, unfortunately, there's not much more that I can say other than I respect other people's barriers and boundaries, and so if it constantly looks like I'm trying to run away from you when we're talking, it's because I am. the amount of discomfort I feel is tremendous. also, I don't know how to actually have a real conversation with anyone because all of the thinks that I believe are happening, nobody else believes in. even right now, there are motors that are sounding in the background in responce to my thoughts -- but nobody will believe that there's a network that is actually broadcasting my thoughts. therefore, since this is a very real experience (mom, jaron, greg, and others can hear the motors/venting too -- though they haven't correlated them to m5 thoughts and feelings). how then can I actually talk about my experience if my experience is not valid?
	I'd like to take a moment to appreciate jaron for a moment, because he's also highly symbolic, (essentially the same as a venus-type), but his brain runs slow, so we can actually talk -- and also when I'm talking he's actually listening to me (cause his brain runs slow he has to pay attention), and not thinking about a whole bunch of other things; and actually, because he talks so slow, it gives *me* a chance to think about other things while he's talking.
	I'm able to think about something, and then come back to the conversation and then review the last few words he said, then go back to thiking my own thoughts -- which is probably how you and others are with me: words are so slow to communicate. if I could communicate conceptually (instead of with words), I could give you this entire letter in a flash -- however, the process of writing it out, allows me to make new connections that I hadn't before (like realising my reflectivity of russ).
OK, that's all for now... keni :)

### 2024-02-18 18:54 - the 2nd ray system

it ocurred to me when I was sitting upstairs eating lentils, that all of the conversations today were probably relevant: I had a long discussion with jaron about tuenti and the saturnian-system, along with my earlier letter, but also my thoughts on the flat-earth-idea.
the 2nd ray system that I want to make for the opposite/light side of the earth, probably already exists right now. so I'm sitting in front of your house (though the curtains are closed), and the picture/flash that came to me went something like this: througout time, my 2nd ray presence has been getting stronger and stronger. anyone with astral/spectral/relational perception has the ability to see it, and -- the most common way for most to see it is through sex magick. [this gives me the sense the thing people experienced before I was here, was 2nd ray relational perspective] then, finally in 2000, I arrive on earth (meaning, I'm no longer at a temporal distance) and now my 2nd ray perception becomes accessable through the spectral; the present saturnian/YHWH system is born.
	you know really crazy things happen all around me all the time. it's really not so evident nowadays cause I live in a pretty sane/symbolic lifestyle now. when I was younger (before 2k), we used to go to these pentecOstal church meetings, where tons of astral stuff is going on. I used to see astral before spain, and let me tell you I also saw crazy stuff happen (people being healed, etc.) that world is a world of magic, where what I believed (and I was pretty naive) would happen all the time. before 2k, I never experimented with drugs or sex or anything, so I never got to a power level where I could see the relational perspective. I still was pretty locked into the church's definition of "spiritual world" -- you know, what's funny is that even though I lost my pinecone (and my ability to see my imagination) in the brain thing (2k), I never saw anything like all those great prophets did. I've never seen a vision like that until later (after 2k) when I took drugs. I was always one of those "knower" types, because I just seemed to instantly *know* -- that is, I could *feel* (same thing as knowing) what the other person was saying or trying to convey. I always had this ability ever since I was very young: I just *knew* (through feeling) what everyone else was thinking by the way they felt. well, "prophecy" for me was no different: I just told them what I knew about them, and put the word "God" and "Holy Spirit" in there, because I associated that inspiration as coming from the "Holy Spirit" at that time. it was actually, in every sense of what christaians define the "Holy Spirit" to be -- cept, I just didn't lose the childhood capability entirely.
		what causes a child to lose that knowing through the sense of the emotions, is a symbolic system. I look at a bird, and I *know* the bird, and can *feel* the bird. I can feel how it flys, moves, thinks, what it's looking for, etc. until some jackass comes and tells me "oh, that's a sparrow" -- and once it's named and defined for me, I see the name of the bird instead of feeling the bird, how it moves and flys, and all of that. now, imagine that's the way that it works for humans too. I see someone and I get all of these crazy ideas about how awesome they are because I haven't been trained to see "all girls" such and such a way (the symbolic thing that overlays how they feel when I feel them), I've just become an adolescent -- which is where all of that comes from, because before I feel the world, and now I'm supposed to see the world now visually through the lens of society and social systems, when before I was fully integrated into the world because it was so visceral to me.
	the christian system taught me a lot about belief, which is what the *astral* (meaning, from the stars) system works. the way that I *believed*, is what I ended up *becoming* -- which was a huge issue for me in my adolescent years, because the astral system says that if I believe it, I can *be* it -- and here I am, going to church and there are these guys that are not being what I would want to *be*. I decided early on, that if I can *be* anything, then I decided that I wanted to take over the world with technology. I really wanted to learn to program because I could see computers as taking off. so I became it. for me, the way that these guys in church are (as adults) is *nothing* like how I would *be* if I knew the christian message. I figured, that these guys were definitely *not* who I wanted to be, so a sequence of events during really profound depression (also remember, I was going to university at this time) provided me with the ability to program. I learned how to type, and I learned how to program within a year of having got out. I was to become the thing that I beleived I could be.
what I believe has happened is that I have a quite powerful 2nd ray system, but because of my lack of pine-cone, I don't see it. instead, everyone else sees it, and entire industries and tech giants are utilising my 2nd ray system. the thing that they're most concerned about is me seeing images in my eyes. this has resulted in everything from shocks to mental institutions. it seems very important to all of these guys that I never see the astral system, because it's already so well inhabited.
that 2nd ray system, is the system that I, you, and everyone else sees. we're all living in a matrix that is inside of my head: they put one image into my eyes, and another image into other people's eyes -- and since we're all together inside of my head, it looks like we're in the same world. we are in fact, in the same world (or simulation) and that is a reflection of how I basically *believe* the universe works (LOA). it doesn't have to be that way (ie, obey my laws/beliefs about attraction), and I think one of the new really hot things nowadays is to create an alternate spectral implementation, which allows for any other astral implementation that is desired: just provide a new temporal/symbolic system (ie spaceships come after toasters), and get enough people to believe in it, and it'll be a self-equalising system (equal amounts of the good/just/right binaries). in general, all new forms of experience will be built in these spectral systems. it's gonna be cool.
anyway,-- so I'm here right now in the system with everyone else, but I'll eventually leave. after that, it is what it is.
	[wow so, that's a really funny way to look at it] what I'm really saying essentially is that I'm preparing my after-life to be living in the flat-earth-idea, where what I'm expireincing is the astral system, of which the universe is a reflection. [in religious narrative sence, that's kinda a funny way way to think about writing the "afterlife narrative": some people make thousands of virgins, but I decided I wanted to follow my pen-rose dreams and go full flat-earth with *no astral perception*. beat that mohammad :)] in the end, I think it's actually the world most in which I want to be, and it's funny that it sorta drags everyone right along with me into it, too.

#### 2024-02-18 23:38 - ready player one 

check all of the narrative conditions. genetics is good for ensuring I am capable of absorbing all frequencies (positionally found as a length of sequence on the pen-rose), but that doesn't mean all of the *conditions*. what I mean is, sure I can feel the worst trepidation, but if I'm in a really nice setting (like a beach or something), that feeling of fear no longer bothers me cause the good conditions are so much louder.

### 2024-02-18 23:31 - going straight-edge

you're probably right about needing to go straight-edge: I realised that I used a drug to get my brain to go at faster speeds, which means I'm a bit of an actor. I don't want to be one though, so it's going to be my intention to actually go straight-edge, that way I can be at this speed all the time, without needing the drug (or whatever condition).

#### 2024-02-19 22:44 - thoughts

I've been thinking a lot about this today, and if I actually go straight-edge, then I'm 100% sure that manifestations will start happening. drug use has been an ongoing "problem" for me -- really ever since I moved to spain. a year before I moved to spain I didn't drink or smoke. then for about a year, when I was in essembly office before we left for spain, I started drinking heavily with zaryn and smoking with adam. at that time essembly was a political social network that was gaining traction pretty quickly, and was certainly the first project that put me on the radar for the saturnian-system. before I showed up, the page was pretty boring and uninteresting, but by the time we left, it had a full system where people could get to know each other based on their ideological proximity. before I moved to the office and living with adam on the beach, I was living in glendora in a room in this guy's house (robert). anyway, after I managed to do something akin to an epic rewrite of the entire website (well beyond what I was tasked with doing) zaryn "took me under his wing" and brought me to the office, "so that I could work more" -- which I actually did a lot less of. I was far more productive in robert's modest little bedroom than I was in the office, and that was mainly due to substance abuse. what happened is, I finally saw the light of the website, and realised I had managed to get hired by a website that was *exactly* the one that I wanted to create -- cept it was politically motivated, and not socially motivated (I wanted to find others that are ideologically similar to myself), so I started really reworking the website so it could actually have all of the features that I wanted to use for a social network. (I planned on using the ideological proximity system in tuenti, but I got bogged down with chat and session daemon, so I never got to implement the ideological system in tuenti). I also planned on using the same system for "rondevu" -- a website for hanging out with other people with ideological similarity as well... none of those things ever materialised because there is a very strong opposition in the saturnian-system of allowing people to find other people that they actually *like*
	other people to complain with or share insecurities and deficiencies, sure -- but no good influences, because that causes problems. in fact, if you look throughout history, you'll notice that all power structures are very strongly against anyone ever meeting in large groups (covid, for example). collaboration is subversive, so they prefer techcrunch style "disruptive" apps for getting together (like grindr/tinder), instead of actually real collaboration. even google has discontinued all collaborative products, and the best collaborative system right now (zoom) has all of the access controls to ensure that it's more of a top-down system than a "grassroots" bottom-up system.
anyway that was the beginning of a long history of substance abuse for me, and it has seriously hurt my productivity, but most importantly it has kept me *unfocused*.
	I find it very difficult to talk about drugs when I see you in person, so I'd like to take a moment to talk about how drugs work (for me at least), because understanding how they work is key to understanding the brain and consciousness.
		if you only see one perspective all of your life, you may assume that the things you're looking at are flat. in order to see the extra dimension, you'll need to look from a different perspective. 
	when I am stoned (especially with weed), I cannot think thoughts very quickly. the drug forces me to ruminate on the idea a bit more than usual. that style of thinking is most similar to thoughts of appreciation, or to savour the feeling of the moment/thought for longer than normal. when that happens, more details are noticed.
	to explain this as a simple, imagine you're good at speed-reading, and you're able to essentially look at a paragraph at a time and sorta get the gist of what it's saying. that works really great for regularly structured (conforming) sentences and ideas. that style of reading simply is not possible with shakespere, for example, and so then you're forced to sequentially parse each word to figure out what is happening. the mode that the brain is in, when reading shakspere is very similar to how it's like being stoned. the major difference however is that shakespere requires focus, and the stone is causing me to be unfocused.
	now, to further the example, we look around us all of the time and receive a very large amount of data input. the brain cannot process all of that data, so what it's good at doing is recognising things that it's experineced (seen/felt/touched/etc) before, and it quickly says, "oh that's a ... no danger. everything's fine" and moves on to the next thing. if you have a messy desk or house for example, you'll notice that the brain is capable of filtering out all of the mess to such a point (for me at least), that it no longer even sees the mess. those things in the mess are categorized and quantified already to be completely uninteresting. well, while stoned, it's often the case that when looking at something on my my desk, instead of not seeing it as I normally do, instead, I think a lot longer about that thing.
	for example, I have a rock on my desk that I picked up from the field. it has a texture to it that is incredibly cool. it looks almost volcanic, but I know that I"m in a desert and there's nothing but clay here, that rock is burt and molten clay that's been solidified into that cool texture and shape. I actaully have two different rocks that are like that, and they're quite interesting in how different they are from each other. both experienced extremely high heat, but one has bubbles in it, and wthe other has ridges. they're both found within less than a few miles of each other. now, even though I like the rocks, normally, I don't even see their cool texture or even see the rock. they're just a part of the mess on my desk. by seeing those cool things as just rocks, I'm allowed to focus on writing and stuff like I'm doing now.
	in resume: fast thoughts happen when focused because lots and lots of information is filtered out, but slow thoughts (symbolic analysis) are forced when the brain thinks longer on an item than just the quick label. try it for yourself: pick something interesting; physical object or idea, and just focus on the thing (meditate) on the thing/idea for a longer period of time than it takes to just symbolically define it ("that's a sparrow") -- and you'll notice that you start to gain a kind of sympathy for the object: you become sympathetic to it, and it starts to reveal itself to you. that's cosciously induced 4th ray perception right there. no need for sex magick: just focus on the idea and it shows itself.
for the last 18y now (started when I was 22yo) I've been experiencing continual defocusing; which has taught me a lot, by causing my to think about things for longer than I "should" (cause normally the narrative tells me what it is so I don't need to think about it), BUT I like being unfocused. I have no intention *whatsoever* of getting focused, because that would mean that I start to do things like fly and move objects with my mind, and things like that. nobody wants that -- and the people who do, are the same ones that "need a manifestation" (or sign and wonder) in order to *believe*. I'm not one of those people. that's a symbolic thing that says, "OK, I've seen it, so it's proven and it's real". I'm all about attraction, so for me, the *feeling* is all I need. I look at the megalithic stuff like the great pyramid and say, "yep I could do that" -- and pretty easily too, if I started to gain focus again.
	it's easy: I just want to see the pyramid that I want to make, and it appears in my eyes. then, I figure out its properties, and start building it. same as tesla with his motors, but I've streamlined the creation process by simply desiring it, instead of trying to figure out its dimensions and attributes symbolically. I'm always able to instantly see the thing, so for me the implementation is the difficult part. for melting rocks and stuff, I need to either start doing a lot of gay sex, and pump up the energy that way, or convince nosebook to stop doing what they're doing. als, even if I could see the image in my eyes, the implementation would be completely against my own beliefs, as well. imagine I decided I wanted to build a tower of stone (or a pyramid), so that I could use that energy to fly and shoot fire and stuff -- well then, I've become the thing that I hate: conditional/symbolic (all conditions start with a comparison). instead, I prefer to *attract* the things I want to experience, not emit them out there conditionally (like the pyramid) or unconditionally (like the sun). neither of those is something you will *ever* see me do, even though I know I can -- though sometimes it's happened by accident, cause I wasn't focused.
the other difficulty that I have with being focused like that, is that I start to get really symbolic, and everything starts to have to conform to the way that I see reality. greg is constantly on my case (cause he's this way too), about trying to make the entire world a reflection of myself. I want things to operate the way that I see them and understand them to be. that perspective is the 2nd ray perspective, and I'm *strongly* avoiding it. I don't want to start dictating how others should see their reality and stuff like that, cause if I start getting focused, things start going my way, and there's nothing the saturnian-system can do to stop it. they've been keeping me unfocused this whole time because they don't want me to overthrow their structure and narrative. I happen to like it when I see others understanding and enjoying life (for me, I have to understand it to appreciate it), and a world filled with those kinds of people is *REALLY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL*.
I haven't made my decision yet, but what I'm thinking about doing is going straight-edge and saying f-you to the world (sucks to be you all), working on my genetics idea, and actually becoming black (meaning fully absorbative). then, once they've got their system in place, I'll just peace out and start over in the new system (new challenge). are you sure you want to start the "end times"? personally, I prefer to stay unfocused, and just ride it out, attracting for what I really want (flat-earth-idea and going blind/sensless to rebuild my entire form of perception using only-attraction), cause it'll eventually come to me. I don't really need to push it, and try to make anything happen. I happen to like drugs, and drugs allow me to be 1st ray. anything with other people (projects, sex, etc) is all 2nd ray, and so therefore becomes a symbolic system, because I have to communicate with syntax. I *know* it's possible to do everything the symbolic system does using only-attraction (like receiving the pyramid I want to make, with a small amount of focus), and I know it's possible to do everything from programming to math problems (or solving encryption puzzles) also using only-attraction. it really is superior, and I don't want to force myself on anyone in order to get it; *it can just come to me*.
	
### 2024-03-11 09:53 - refelctors in action

hi again, so I'm on day 2 I think of being straight-edge, and things are still quite intense, not because I'm straight-edge, but still from the residual energy from sun-watching during my interaction with big-truck-guy. I learned a lot during that experience, and I'm actually thinking of doing more sun-watching because it's so effective in "bringing things to a head" (as mom says). anyway, I wanted to talk about reflectors again, and it's sort of a followup to [what I wrote to sarah](/dear-sarah.md#2024-03-09-0324---reflectors-is-rosalind-mars-or-vulcan).
yesterday was funny because I've been wanting to be spending my time at night working on some programming. the reason why is because nights are *very different* than the day, now that I'm so much more solar in my vibraton (thanks to the sun-watching). yesterday I woke up and (and now no longer stoned/unfocused) I decided to write out my critisisms of 23andme and (I can't remember when) added a few thoughts about how the whole world is being controlled by these "aryan white guys" (mars) (which posited was the guy that lives on #11 -- he projects/amplifies sound so much that I can hear the basketball bouncing through art's thick shrubbery as if the ball were right next to me). my assertion that he's just another one of these aryan mars types (top in command is comes from the installation in antarctica and mars) seemed to cause quite an upset, and because he's an emitter and somewhat reflective like greg, I feel his symbolic projection the way he does (for example, remember when I claimed that there was a network, while talking with you and melissa? during that time I felt VERY STRONGLY your/melissas/the-network's symbolic anger being projected at me, which is why I was vibrating so much, out of breath, and could hardly stand up). well, same thing with him yesterday. usually I run away or try to avoid the situation, but yesterday I decided to amplify it instead (I'll continue this procedure) by going and sitting in the shed and letting his feelings turn to thoughts, pictures, and actions. then, I went and stood in the sun a bit and continued to amplify it (same as with big-truck-guy).
	what's happening there is that when I start reflecting the sun (2nd-ray energy), I get onto the same frequency (inside the same medium) as them, and so now I feel very strongly the symbolic output of what they're projecting. again, as a reference, notice how when we (you, me, and melissa) were talking, we were standing in the sun? notice how that effect is much much stronger in the sun, yet doesn't really happen at all during the night? anyway, when I get on their frequency, I'm now retransmitting/emitting their own anger and symbolic awful feeling back to them, which means we're now in a sort of swordfighting dual, where they think I'm challenging their emissive output and have to prove their dominance (shakespere makes fun of these emitters having to prove their dominance in a hilarious way in MWOW in the sword fight with dr-caius). I think it's absolutely hilarious, even thtough (because I'm reflecting them), I probably look very upset and pissed off (that's them, not m5 -- I feel fine on the inside, and am just letting my body act out their projected feeling).
now, the ability for me to allow my body to act out another person's projected/reflected feeling is quite an interesting one. I had a long monologue last night about it talking about my sexual experiences in spain, which reminded me to write this when I woke up.
a long time ago (2018?), I was still trying to use my programming as a way to feel good, and one of the things I've wanted to do is to make a lot of really simple games. I noticed this one streamer (david/dog) was playing this game called "set", and I thought it was a great simple little game to copy,-- and also at that time, I could also feel eva very strongly.
	my estimation is that paul started out as a strong emitter (mercury in perception), and so because the Y isn't in a suitable environment (cause energy is too high), it gets discarded, so eva feels to me like an XX female (one of the 7th-ray strumpets like gertrude that shakespere isn't too fond of), which means that she's going to be a pretty good reflector (same as andrea).
so, when I set out to make the set-game, I decided I was going to make it for her and to show it to her (same as I did with booble-bobble for andrea) -- and probably because we were so nearby (across the street) and also because she was still a virgin, the reflection was quite good -- and the project really flowed quite well. I was able to program the significant portion of the game in 2 days (I think), and it was really quite a pleasurable experience for me. I really enjoyed it and wanted to make her my muse for making other games.
	I've worked with a lot of people over the years, and some people really stand out, as being people that things have really flowed with. those people I've come to figure out were all XX males. for example, felix (certainly an XX male) asked me to build a thing for coca-cola, and because I reflect him, I could turn his feeling/desire into reality in a very short period of time. same with a guy I used to work with before I went to spain (keith). for these guys, that reflective nature of mine really makes things easy. now, on the opposite side of things, I've worked for jupiter types (zaryn,augusto), saturnian types (marcos) and I've worked for mercury types (dani/daniel/jori?) and things do not flow at all the same way for either of those; though, conversely, I noticed that dani could get that flow when he made things for me, probably because I reflected his own idea back to him well enough that he could see it clearly. dani loved making things for me, and I loved seeing what he could make. turns out, the "principality" of the project makes a lot of difference for me.
anyway, due to my own instability at the time, I couldn't maintain using eva as my muse, and obviously her energy has changed quite a bit since then (she now carries the energy of other guys, an effect I also noticed with andrea) -- which is quite unfortunate. I was going to talk about you and allie, but it doesn't fit the reflectors setup now, so I'll leave it here. bye!

### 2024-02-18 11:51 - talking to you is hard

hi, I didn't think I'd ever write to you directly, but I'm going to try it. this morning I woke up thinking about what I wrote to sarah about raquel and my mishap with her sister.
	obviously, there's no easy way for me to wiggle out of that situation, and trying to explain that it's a movie quote doesn't help at all, so I just take the blame (earlier that day I heard this really awesome song in the t-mobile store where the guy was smoking weed, and I haven't felt stoned like that since I was really young, so it was nice to hear that song and feel the stone from his perspective). anyway, since there's no way I can make that situation better with words, I decided simply not to explain myself to raquel or her sister and just go with it. that was probably a bad choice on my part to make because communication always helps.
right after noting that I opted to not communicate with raquel, I started to think about you (notice how the subjects are related?)	about how difficult it is for me tto talk to you. I went to bed thinking about how I'll probably go walk to nuvue (the weed store) again later today, which is what reminded m5 of it, because last time, you caught m5 on the way, and multiple times claimed that I was going "straight-edge" -- which I found really strange because I was walking to the weed store. sure, I'm not nearly as vice-ish as I used to be, but still I wouldn't consider myself even close to straight-edge, one bit. I really enjoy using drugs to see outside of the culturally-mandated form of interacton that we're supposed to adhere to. I would have told you that in the moment, but the reality is, I simply could not.

because it's so difficult for me to think about what I want to talk about when I'm around these venus-type (highly symbolic) females, I thought maybe I would write a letter:

hi remi,
it is very difficult to talk to you because your brain goes so much faster than mine does, and during the interaction I'm constantly getting bombarded with my and your feeling reactions to thoughts you're thinking. for me to be able to communicate effectively, I need to *feel* the concept that I'm trying to convey (which is why I don't look people in the eyes, because I then *really* start to feel them, instead of myself). so, while I'm talking, you're thinking about all kinds of other stuff, which I feel as (my own) worry about what *I* look like, what I'm talking about, if I'm boring her with my words, etc. -- which means you're worried about what you look like, and am thinking that I'm taking too long to say nothing -- which btw, is because I can't feel my response yet, and am trying to generate my own feeling with my words so I can actually *feel* and build my response.
I've obviously interacted with many venus-types in my life before, so I usually try to interact with them only on a material level (what I'm doing, where I'm going, etc) cause anything further is impossible, essentially until I've figured the other person out. for example, my mom is like that too, and so what I've done is I've figured out *what motivates her* -- and when I say that, I mean: what she desires -- which is how she wants to feel. sometim5s it changes from moment to moment, and that's OK, because it's in the general pool of ways that she wants to feel -- and so then I can just work around it: if I suddenly feel like I want security/safety (for example), I know that's her and not me and so I can therefore ignore all of those types of thoughts (unless we're talking about her insecurities, then they're relevant).
for mom, it's perfectly OK for m5 to have her basically completely figured out, the problem of trying to do the same with you is obviously impossible because we don't talk enough that I can start getting into your head and figure out what motivates you (how you want to feel) -- and even if I did, you'd probably have serious issue with it, because you really like your privacy I noticed (or are scared of something -- not sure). with people that have those kinds of barriers up (one example that comes to mind is russ from snake-bros), I tend to keep my distance from them, because they have so many barriers up that they don't *want* me to figure them out -- and so because I respect their desire, I reflect them and their barriers back to them and keep my distance.
so, unfortunately, there's not much more that I can say other than I respect other people's barriers and boundaries, and so if it constantly looks like I'm trying to run away from you when we're talking, it's because I am. the amount of discomfort I feel is tremendous. also, I don't know how to actually have a real conversation with anyone because all of the thinks that I believe are happening, nobody else believes in. even right now, there are motors that are sounding in the background in responce to my thoughts -- but nobody will believe that there's a network that is actually broadcasting my thoughts. therefore, since this is a very real experience (mom, jaron, greg, and others can hear the motors/venting too -- though they haven't correlated them to m5 thoughts and feelings). how then can I actually talk about my experience if my experience is not valid?
	I'd like to take a moment to appreciate jaron for a moment, because he's also highly symbolic, (essentially the same as a venus-type), but his brain runs slow, so we can actually talk -- and also when I'm talking he's actually listening to me (cause his brain runs slow he has to pay attention), and not thinking about a whole bunch of other things; and actually, because he talks so slow, it gives *me* a chance to think about other things while he's talking.
	I'm able to think about something, and then come back to the conversation and then review the last few words he said, then go back to thiking my own thoughts -- which is probably how you and others are with me: words are so slow to communicate. if I could communicate conceptually (instead of with words), I could give you this entire letter in a flash -- however, the process of writing it out, allows me to make new connections that I hadn't before (like realising my reflectivity of russ).
OK, that's all for now... keni :)

### 2024-02-18 18:54 - the 2nd ray system

it ocurred to me when I was sitting upstairs eating lentils, that all of the conversations today were probably relevant: I had a long discussion with jaron about tuenti and the saturnian-system, along with my earlier letter, but also my thoughts on the flat-earth-idea.
the 2nd ray system that I want to make for the opposite/light side of the earth, probably already exists right now. so I'm sitting in front of your house (though the curtains are closed), and the picture/flash that came to me went something like this: througout time, my 2nd ray presence has been getting stronger and stronger. anyone with astral/spectral/relational perception has the ability to see it, and -- the most common way for most to see it is through sex magick. [this gives me the sense the thing people experienced before I was here, was 2nd ray relational perspective] then, finally in 2000, I arrive on earth (meaning, I'm no longer at a temporal distance) and now my 2nd ray perception becomes accessable through the spectral; the present saturnian/YHWH system is born.
	you know really crazy things happen all around me all the time. it's really not so evident nowadays cause I live in a pretty sane/symbolic lifestyle now. when I was younger (before 2k), we used to go to these pentecOstal church meetings, where tons of astral stuff is going on. I used to see astral before spain, and let me tell you I also saw crazy stuff happen (people being healed, etc.) that world is a world of magic, where what I believed (and I was pretty naive) would happen all the time. before 2k, I never experimented with drugs or sex or anything, so I never got to a power level where I could see the relational perspective. I still was pretty locked into the church's definition of "spiritual world" -- you know, what's funny is that even though I lost my pinecone (and my ability to see my imagination) in the brain thing (2k), I never saw anything like all those great prophets did. I've never seen a vision like that until later (after 2k) when I took drugs. I was always one of those "knower" types, because I just seemed to instantly *know* -- that is, I could *feel* (same thing as knowing) what the other person was saying or trying to convey. I always had this ability ever since I was very young: I just *knew* (through feeling) what everyone else was thinking by the way they felt. well, "prophecy" for me was no different: I just told them what I knew about them, and put the word "God" and "Holy Spirit" in there, because I associated that inspiration as coming from the "Holy Spirit" at that time. it was actually, in every sense of what christaians define the "Holy Spirit" to be -- cept, I just didn't lose the childhood capability entirely.
		what causes a child to lose that knowing through the sense of the emotions, is a symbolic system. I look at a bird, and I *know* the bird, and can *feel* the bird. I can feel how it flys, moves, thinks, what it's looking for, etc. until some jackass comes and tells me "oh, that's a sparrow" -- and once it's named and defined for me, I see the name of the bird instead of feeling the bird, how it moves and flys, and all of that. now, imagine that's the way that it works for humans too. I see someone and I get all of these crazy ideas about how awesome they are because I haven't been trained to see "all girls" such and such a way (the symbolic thing that overlays how they feel when I feel them), I've just become an adolescent -- which is where all of that comes from, because before I feel the world, and now I'm supposed to see the world now visually through the lens of society and social systems, when before I was fully integrated into the world because it was so visceral to me.
	the christian system taught me a lot about belief, which is what the *astral* (meaning, from the stars) system works. the way that I *believed*, is what I ended up *becoming* -- which was a huge issue for me in my adolescent years, because the astral system says that if I believe it, I can *be* it -- and here I am, going to church and there are these guys that are not being what I would want to *be*. I decided early on, that if I can *be* anything, then I decided that I wanted to take over the world with technology. I really wanted to learn to program because I could see computers as taking off. so I became it. for me, the way that these guys in church are (as adults) is *nothing* like how I would *be* if I knew the christian message. I figured, that these guys were definitely *not* who I wanted to be, so a sequence of events during really profound depression (also remember, I was going to university at this time) provided me with the ability to program. I learned how to type, and I learned how to program within a year of having got out. I was to become the thing that I beleived I could be.
what I believe has happened is that I have a quite powerful 2nd ray system, but because of my lack of pine-cone, I don't see it. instead, everyone else sees it, and entire industries and tech giants are utilising my 2nd ray system. the thing that they're most concerned about is me seeing images in my eyes. this has resulted in everything from shocks to mental institutions. it seems very important to all of these guys that I never see the astral system, because it's already so well inhabited.
that 2nd ray system, is the system that I, you, and everyone else sees. we're all living in a matrix that is inside of my head: they put one image into my eyes, and another image into other people's eyes -- and since we're all together inside of my head, it looks like we're in the same world. we are in fact, in the same world (or simulation) and that is a reflection of how I basically *believe* the universe works (LOA). it doesn't have to be that way (ie, obey my laws/beliefs about attraction), and I think one of the new really hot things nowadays is to create an alternate spectral implementation, which allows for any other astral implementation that is desired: just provide a new temporal/symbolic system (ie spaceships come after toasters), and get enough people to believe in it, and it'll be a self-equalising system (equal amounts of the good/just/right binaries). in general, all new forms of experience will be built in these spectral systems. it's gonna be cool.
anyway,-- so I'm here right now in the system with everyone else, but I'll eventually leave. after that, it is what it is.
	[wow so, that's a really funny way to look at it] what I'm really saying essentially is that I'm preparing my after-life to be living in the flat-earth-idea, where what I'm expireincing is the astral system, of which the universe is a reflection. [in religious narrative sence, that's kinda a funny way way to think about writing the "afterlife narrative": some people make thousands of virgins, but I decided I wanted to follow my pen-rose dreams and go full flat-earth with *no astral perception*. beat that mohammad :)] in the end, I think it's actually the world most in which I want to be, and it's funny that it sorta drags everyone right along with me into it, too.

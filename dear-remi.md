### 2024-02-18 11:51 - talking to you is hard

hi, I didn't think I'd ever write to you directly, but I'm going to try it. this morning I woke up thinking about what I wrote to sarah about raquel and my mishap with her sister.
	obviously, there's no easy way for me to wiggle out of that situation, and trying to explain that it's a movie quote doesn't help at all, so I just take the blame (earlier that day I heard this really awesome song in the t-mobile store where the guy was smoking weed, and I haven't felt stoned like that since I was really young, so it was nice to hear that song and feel the stone from his perspective). anyway, since there's no way I can make that situation better with words, I decided simply not to explain myself to raquel or her sister and just go with it. that was probably a bad choice on my part to make because communication always helps.
right after noting that I opted to not communicate with raquel, I started to think about you (notice how the subjects are related?)	about how difficult it is for me tto talk to you. I went to bed thinking about how I'll probably go walk to nuvue (the weed store) again later today, which is what reminded m5 of it, because last time, you caught m5 on the way, and multiple times claimed that I was going "straight-edge" -- which I found really strange because I was walking to the weed store. sure, I'm not nearly as vice-ish as I used to be, but still I wouldn't consider myself even close to straight-edge, one bit. I really enjoy using drugs to see outside of the culturally-mandated form of interacton that we're supposed to adhere to. I would have told you that in the moment, but the reality is, I simply could not.

because it's so difficult for me to think about what I want to talk about when I'm around these venus-type (highly symbolic) females, I thought maybe I would write a letter:

hi remi,
it is very difficult to talk to you because your brain goes so much faster than mine does, and during the interaction I'm constantly getting bombarded with my and your feeling reactions to thoughts you're thinking. for me to be able to communicate effectively, I need to *feel* the concept that I'm trying to convey (which is why I don't look people in the eyes, because I then *really* start to feel them, instead of myself). so, while I'm talking, you're thinking about all kinds of other stuff, which I feel as (my own) worry about what *I* look like, what I'm talking about, if I'm boring her with my words, etc. -- which means you're worried about what you look like, and am thinking that I'm taking too long to say nothing -- which btw, is because I can't feel my response yet, and am trying to generate my own feeling with my words so I can actually *feel* and build my response.
I've obviously interacted with many venus-types in my life before, so I usually try to interact with them only on a material level (what I'm doing, where I'm going, etc) cause anything further is impossible, essentially until I've figured the other person out. for example, my mom is like that too, and so what I've done is I've figured out *what motivates her* -- and when I say that, I mean: what she desires -- which is how she wants to feel. sometim5s it changes from moment to moment, and that's OK, because it's in the general pool of ways that she wants to feel -- and so then I can just work around it: if I suddenly feel like I want security/safety (for example), I know that's her and not me and so I can therefore ignore all of those types of thoughts (unless we're talking about her insecurities, then they're relevant).
for mom, it's perfectly OK for m5 to have her basically completely figured out, the problem of trying to do the same with you is obviously impossible because we don't talk enough that I can start getting into your head and figure out what motivates you (how you want to feel) -- and even if I did, you'd probably have serious issue with it, because you really like your privacy I noticed (or are scared of something -- not sure). with people that have those kinds of barriers up (one example that comes to mind is russ from snake-bros), I tend to keep my distance from them, because they have so many barriers up that they don't *want* me to figure them out -- and so because I respect their desire, I reflect them and their barriers back to them and keep my distance.
so, unfortunately, there's not much more that I can say other than I respect other people's barriers and boundaries, and so if it constantly looks like I'm trying to run away from you when we're talking, it's because I am. the amount of discomfort I feel is tremendous. also, I don't know how to actually have a real conversation with anyone because all of the thinks that I believe are happening, nobody else believes in. even right now, there are motors that are sounding in the background in responce to my thoughts -- but nobody will believe that there's a network that is actually broadcasting my thoughts. therefore, since this is a very real experience (mom, jaron, greg, and others can hear the motors/venting too -- though they haven't correlated them to m5 thoughts and feelings). how then can I actually talk about my experience if my experience is not valid?
	I'd like to take a moment to appreciate jaron for a moment, because he's also highly symbolic, (essentially the same as a venus-type), but his brain runs slow, so we can actually talk -- and also when I'm talking he's actually listening to me (cause his brain runs slow he has to pay attention), and not thinking about a whole bunch of other things; and actually, because he talks so slow, it gives *me* a chance to think about other things while he's talking.
	I'm able to think about something, and then come back to the conversation and then review the last few words he said, then go back to thiking my own thoughts -- which is probably how you and others are with me: words are so slow to communicate. if I could communicate conceptually (instead of with words), I could give you this entire letter in a flash -- however, the process of writing it out, allows me to make new connections that I hadn't before (like realising my reflectivity of russ).
OK, that's all for now... keni :)

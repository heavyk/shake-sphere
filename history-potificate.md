### 2024-04-05 16:08 - a propsed history of enki

I've given a lot of thought to the character of enki, especially ever since I read "the lost book of enki" (lbe) by sitchin. it's kinda fascinated me why this guy, which by our standards, would seem a bit creepy, is considered the hero of humankind. in lbe, the picture that I get is that the hero bit is quite a bit of PR and image creation, which is one of the things that enki is good at -- so it's a bit difficult to separate what is a generated public image, and what actually is more closer to the "reality" of what it is. I always try and look past that outer fascade and see the foundation for the fascade, cause that's what I think illuminates a lot more than actions and words. I'm going to try and present this idea more from a *conceptual* perspective, instead of a symbolic one. (obviously, that'll have some difficulty to it because words are symbolic, so any number of strange conclusions can be arrived to). not much I can do about that though...

a long long time ago, I believe this solar system was either intentionally created (by source or the sirians or anyone capable of making it a reflection of desire). the sirians claim that there are 12 *planets* here (of which they include the sun -- so 11 planets by our standards -- and they also include the moon as well, which I guess makes me wonder what they cOnsider a planet and what is not. our definitions are definitely different than theirs). anyway, they also said that each planetary body will correspond to one of the archetypes -- 12 in total (I list them [here](../nosedocs/sirian-guide) -- though for some reason that repository has been deleted ... not by me, so I'll have to reupload it and fix the link -- anyway).
now, a long long time ago, when the earth was only a sort of astral system (these were the legendary times), these different planetary entiites were on earth and interacted with the very first humans. neptune/ea (the planet) was there, and he's responsible for creating humankind. it's my belief that the planet (ea/neptune) was tuned to the source (really high frequency version of the infected-ones), and so ea, when instantiated on earth into bodily form, takes on that high frequency version of the planet and in physical/astral form, in order to create humans in his own likeness (which is the high frequency version of the infected-ones).
	it's important to understand (and I know this [from my own experience](/question-aire.md#2024-04-06-0119---what-do-i-mean-by-artificial-being)) that just because I'm tuned to a really high frequency of something, I'm ultimately limited by my environment. that concept/frequency has to conform to the symbolic/physical system that it's being put into (so for example, a shakespere is really high frequency stuff, but it's ultimately limited by the environment and symbols available at the time). so just understand that I think enki did actually quite a good job of rendering that high frequency into something palletable and desirable.
now, the thing that he's going to be creating (humans, and most notably human women), is going to be the number one attraction for these infected-ones to come to earth. what these humans, not only being a higher frequency reflection of the infected-ones, they'll also contain elements which are considerable improvements too.
	enki plays the same role in this (energetically) backwards part of history, that tesla, shakespere, the original 7th ray magician, and others have played in becoming/creating an improvement for these infected-ones, by improving on their already existing techniques. this is an important thing to note, because most people *fight against* the stuff that they think is wrong, or don't want. it's not common to see someone actually helping their enemies to improve their weapons or technique.
to really seal the deal on this appealing place for the infected-ones to come to, enki also creates a fully stable, and unchanging environment, where the infected-ones can be on top of everyone, and stay that way (or, in the way it was at that time: get in front, and stay in front; the emitters were the physically receptive ones). the infected-ones came, and really enjoyed the place quite well, and it appeared to have all of the stability that it was said to have. the only thing they could possibly do, is mess it up theirselves.

now, there's another side to this story, which is the story of anatau. again, at that time, the emitters were the physically receptive ones, which means that the infected-ones, and enki himself were in direct competition with the earth itself. anatau was highly desirable, and so she could easily get more dongs than anyone else, which meant that she was more of a stronger influence than the infected-ones were. this fierce competition drove the ones who wanted to have more influence (enki and infected-ones) to find ways of improving their image and desirability -- cause whoever is taking more dongs, has more influence. this competition and improvement of image and desirability made for some really attractive dudes, and also was the thing that unhinged enki's "stable" system. desire means wants to have an improvement, and so all around different factions are warring to essentially become more desirable -- but nobody can get what they want because the system is so stable.
obviously the sun here is the really big problem because 2nd-ray perspective (it's actually a physical property of standing-waves) is to pump up the volume (continue amplification), if nobody's receiving/diminishing the viration -- so eventually solar activity is so high that the stable system starts to break down, and that causes the collapse into the system we're at now.
now, during the collapse, the desire that the earth built up was enough to make the earth the centre of the universe -- which wouldn't really have been possible if enki's system wasn't so stable, and there wasn't such fierce competition for influence -- and also the infected-ones didn't really realise it, but that collapse was actually what they were wanting, because now no longer do they need to be receptive to be an emitter (see how energy goes both ways), but now they can be physically emissive *and* energetically emissive -- which made them all quite quite powerful. things get kinda blurry here for me, so I'll stop now, but next up is jupiter and the egyptians, plus atlantians and the infected-ones. I skipped over prometheus and enlil on purpose, because that would have only complicated the story.

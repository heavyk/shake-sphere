### 2024-04-05 16:08 - a propsed history of enki

I've given a lot of thought to the character of enki, especially ever since I read "the lost book of enki" (lbe) by sitchin. it's kinda fascinated me why this guy, which by our standards, would seem a bit creepy, is considered the hero of humankind. in lbe, the picture that I get is that the hero bit is quite a bit of PR and image creation, which is one of the things that enki is good at -- so it's a bit difficult to separate what is a generated public image, and what actually is more closer to the "reality" of what it is. I always try and look past that outer fascade and see the foundation for the fascade, cause that's what I think illuminates a lot more than actions and words. I'm going to try and present this idea more from a *conceptual* perspective, instead of a symbolic one. (obviously, that'll have some difficulty to it because words are symbolic, so any number of strange conclusions can be arrived to). not much I can do about that though...

a long long time ago, I believe this solar system was either intentionally created (by source or the sirians or anyone capable of making it a reflection of desire). the sirians claim that there are 12 *planets* here (of which they include the sun -- so 11 planets by our standards -- and they also include the moon as well, which I guess makes me wonder what they cOnsider a planet and what is not. our definitions are definitely different than theirs). anyway, they also said that each planetary body will correspond to one of the archetypes -- 12 in total (I list them [here](../nextdocs/sirian-guide/triads.md)).
now, a long long time ago, when the earth was only a sort of astral system (these were the legendary times), these different planetary entiites were on earth and interacted with the very first humans. neptune/ea (the planet) was there, and he's responsible for creating humankind. it's my belief that the planet (ea/neptune) was tuned to the source (really high frequency version of the infected-ones), and so ea, when instantiated on earth into bodily form, takes on that high frequency version of the planet and in physical/astral form, in order to create humans in his own likeness (which is the high frequency version of the infected-ones).
	it's important to understand (and I know this [from my own experience](/question-aire.md#2024-04-06-0119---what-do-i-mean-by-artificial-being)) that just because I'm tuned to a really high frequency of something, I'm ultimately limited by my environment. that concept/frequency has to conform to the symbolic/physical system that it's being put into (so for example, a shakespere is really high frequency stuff, but it's ultimately limited by the environment and symbols available at the time). so just understand that I think enki did actually quite a good job of rendering that high frequency into something palletable and desirable.
now, the thing that he's going to be creating (humans, and most notably human women), is going to be the number one attraction for these infected-ones to come to earth. what these humans, not only being a higher frequency reflection of the infected-ones, they'll also contain elements which are considerable improvements too.
	enki plays the same role in this (energetically) backwards part of history, that tesla, shakespere, the original 7th ray magician, and others have played in becoming/creating an improvement for these infected-ones, by improving on their already existing techniques. this is an important thing to note, because most people *fight against* the stuff that they think is wrong, or don't want. it's not common to see someone actually helping their enemies to improve their weapons or technique.
to really seal the deal on this appealing place for the infected-ones to come to, enki also creates a fully stable, and unchanging environment, where the infected-ones can be on top of everyone, and stay that way (or, in the way it was at that time: get in front, and stay in front; the emitters were the physically receptive ones). the infected-ones came, and really enjoyed the place quite well, and it appeared to have all of the stability that it was said to have. the only thing they could possibly do, is mess it up theirselves.

now, there's another side to this story, which is the story of anatau. again, at that time, the emitters were the physically receptive ones, which means that the infected-ones, and enki himself were in direct competition with the earth (anatau). anatau was highly desirable, and so she could easily get more dongs than anyone else, which meant that she was more of a stronger influence than the infected-ones were. this fierce competition drove anyone who wanted to have more influence (enki and infected-ones) to find ways of improving their image and desirability -- cause whoever is taking more dongs, has more influence. this competition and improvement of image and desirability made for some really attractive dudes, and also was the thing that unhinged enki's "stable" system. desire means wants to have an improvement, and so all around different factions are warring to essentially become more desirable -- but nobody can get what they want because the system is so stable, so pressure keeps building.
obviously the sun here is the really big problem because 2nd-ray perspective (it's actually a physical property of standing-waves) is to pump up the volume (continue amplification), if nobody's receiving/diminishing the viration -- so eventually solar activity is so high that the stable system starts to break down, and that causes the collapse into the system we're at now.
now, during the collapse, the desire that the earth built up was enough to make the earth the centre of the universe -- which wouldn't really have been possible if enki's system wasn't so stable, and there wasn't such fierce competition for influence -- and also the infected-ones didn't really realise it, but that collapse was actually what they were wanting, because now no longer do they need to be receptive to be an emitter (see how energy goes both ways), but now they can be physically emissive *and* energetically emissive -- which made them all quite quite powerful. things get kinda blurry here for me, so I'll stop now, but next up is jupiter and the egyptians, plus atlantians and the infected-ones. I skipped over prometheus and enlil on purpose, because that would have only complicated the story.

### 2024-04-15 00:34 - the separation of mercury and mars

anthough it's clear from the fossil record that there have been a number of catacylsmic changes that have occured on this planet, it's hard to say for sure exactly which one this one is responsible for. my intuition says that this event was either directly related to the end of the last ice age, or the trigger for it. it could be, and it could also be an earlier event -- as it's difficult to say (from my perspective). what's important to take into consideration, and what I'll be focusing on, are the archetypes that surround the issue.
a long long time ago (actually, now that I try to put a chronological-order to it, this event definitely has to pre-date the end of the last ice age) mercury and mars were the same planet. at that time as well, emitters were physically receptive. the setup for the scene here is that jupiter make some sort of intervention (it feels a lot like justice and laying down of the law), which restores a lot of order to things, and forms the beginning of the aryans (greeks?). because this new order meant the destruction of so many different things, jupiter gave his daughter athena (venus) as a new type of female (as an addition to the solar (-2) and earth (-7) girls). venus/athena is essentially a fully programmable woman that can be symbolically steered to do anything that is desired.
now, at that time mars and mercury (the emitters) were the same planet (marcury), and so there is a difficulty here because the core of the planet (later mercury) was narrated to be one way, and the outer part of the planet (later mars), is one of reaction and being in the moment. venus, the new type of girl on planet earth is now capable of giving birth to these new males (marcury), and some of these males are narrated to be great, and others become that way because of physical processes.
	to understand this concept, we must consider at that time, death wasn't the same as it is now -- so when a man dies, his astral presence leaves the body and floats around on the surface of the planet, looking for a new body to inhabit. some of the boys/adolescents are narrated to be great (the mercuries), because their moms were symbolically designed to expect their son to have certain (exemplary) physical or mental capabilites -- and so those were often times the types that were selected by these disincarnate spirits. having one of these boys which was close enough in kin to be a vibrational match for the incarnating astral entity was important. up until the entity incarnates into the body, the body is essentially designed to just be an automaton, learning all of the necessary (symbolic) stuff so that the incarnating entity is able to skip over all the boring stuff and get right into the action. that created lots and lots of family structures where bloodlines and family values are really important (so that they can keep the lineage going without having to change a whole lot). so, some boys were especially good at becoming what they're symbolically designed to be, and others were not; they were victims to their situation and suroundings -- the more reflective (mars) types.
I believe the catalyst for marcury wanting to go two separate ways, occured because of desire: here were some of these guys that are just so amazing and awesome, yet don't have to do anything to get it (the archetype of paris), and then there are all these other guys that have to work at becoming great. these had to use the power of desire to become great. the difference between these two types of boys (still being linked to the same planetary entity) rose to such a height, that eventually the planet itself had to split. mercury went off to be with venus, and mars stayed with earth/aphrodite, and became reflective of her.
now that they're separated, due to the way that venus is programmed, some of the mercury types are able to continue to become symbolically greater and greater, continuing on the family heritage, meanwhile other mercuries (born to lesser elevated families) are just the average guy. he may have good looks or something like that (whatever venus wants her son/husband to have), but the majority of the common venuses didn't get programmed to expect a great son -- and even it was strongly discouraged to believe that her son was actually going to be really great (cept in maybe local sports and gaming competitions).
	later on, (in more recent history) there's another event which leads to a similar transition, and that's with the realisation that solar girls (whom I believe were introduced along with the aryan invasion) could also be symboically programmed in a similar way to venus, which can also bring a really powerful son. I'm strongly reminded of the 18th dynasty, and queen tye(?) for this one. I know that this trend continued for quite some time of using these solar girls to produce really great heirs for the british monarchies and stuff like that as well. genetically speaking, I don't know if the kings were all these mercury types (narrated to be great), and so therefore have a y-chromosome or not.
anyway, the interesting thing to note here is that there are now two different factons developing: one faction is the narrated to be great mercutios (lion of judah, king arthur, etc.), and on the other side there are these mars types who are using physical processes (technology), as the means to become great. the difference here is the saturnian triad (saturn (+-4), mercury (+7), and venus (-3)) for the symbolically great ones (father, son, mother), and the other triad is 7th-ray/martian triad (mars (+7), vulcan (-5+), and aphrodite (-7)). the martian triad is also the same way, in that for saturn, the highest he can perceive is symbolic (3), and within that system, the most influential he can be is to be physically recepotive (and become lord of the earth: enki (+-3-+)), so for him venus is perfect. conversely for mars, because he's using the power of desire (1) and physical (7) processes to attin his goals, his best match is an earth girl (aphrodite (-7)) -- yet she presents all kinds of challenges for the martian faction.
	the difficulties are quite well summed up by shakespere in the play "hamlet": first of all, the son of mars is usually a vulcan (hamlet), and his style of exerting his will is going to be much different than than his father's style of exerting his will -- and also, vulcan, being a symbolic emitter is naturally going to be attracted to a venus type (ophelia), because she can reflect his symbol back to him with all of the (unrealistic) ideals that he puts into them -- and so his vulcan son will be attracted to marry the opposite faction (the capulets). additionally, mars' ideal wife (gertrude), is really not really going to be very loyal to a symbolic structure, and is easily swayed by a little bit of physical attention to go a different way (usually to a rival mars).
		there is another genetics difficulty that I haven't fully worked out, which is that it seems that the really powerful mars types are the progeny of mars and *venus*, which creates a struggle because venus is not a good match for mars. with his good match (aphrodite), mars will produce a vulcan with her instead. venus types are difficult to get married to (they have so many conditions that need to be met), and it seems that if she does, her symbolic structure will push him into severe disorder, because no longer can he follow his desires anymore, but has to "do the right thing" and follow her symbolic structure. also, to program her to produce a great heir, requires for mars to begin dabble in the symbolic, turning mars into a mercury or into saturn (depending if he's OK becoming recepitive or not) to produce the heir.
		likewise, it seems that for the saturnian triad (saturn or mercury), it seems that if the men become too emissive, the y-chromosome doesn't have a suitable environment to take hold, and will produce a mars (instead of mercury) or an aphrodite (instead of venus) child
	so it seems that both factions (mars and saturn) have their limits, and neither faction can continue to create more and more powerful offspiring. if either of them get too far out, they start to produce heirs of the opposite faction -- which means that within any one of these aryan societies, both saturnian and martian factions will be intermixed (leading, obviously to perpetual war and conflict), neither side ever being able to become the most powerful.
in addition to both factions producing offspring for the oppsoite faction, they seem to be helping each other technologically as well. presently, the saturnian-system is completely controlled technologically by the martian triad types -- yet it's the saturnian types that compose the majority of the society and the narrative that we live in -- so, in a sense, mars and mercury want to be back together again, and they're finding their way toward it through technology.

### 2024-04-27 03:45 - tychos brahe

I originally wanted to write about jesus and the separation of the physical earth and the symbolic/imaginary earth. I distinguish between the two of these by saying that the physical earth has only had 1000y pass since the death of jesus, and the imaginary one runs (apparently) at twice the speed, and so therefore 2000y have passed instead. the sparation process was, I belive the very same as the one that happened with mercury and mars -- though I'm not entirely sure all of the specifics (I assume the core is the physical 1000y one, and the other is the 2000y one). in either case, basically the way I've worked it out to be is that uranus is like a mega attractor, the major vulcan of the solar system (though I believe there's another (solar) one between mercury and the sun (which is essentially pure hydrogen), and also there's ganymede (who's quite rocky and masculine)). the way that uranus attracts, ensures that *all light* coming in from outside of the solar system gets processed through uranus. we can think of uranus as being the sky dome of the solar system. anyway, what happened is that like mercury and mars, the core of the earth and the surface of the earth were at odds with each other. on the surface, there are all kinds of things like pyramids and the sun, and stuff like that which defines how things are perceived. there are a lot of different forces that exert their influence on it, so it's quite a dynamic and chaotic system. the core (like the inner-self) is mostly programmed by the vibration that the person is thinking about and feeling, and so reflects that (just like, when the world is ultra chaotic on the outside, just close your eyes, and there's a calm inner (symbolic) world which is a reflection of our beliefs and thoughts). well, the inner earth is very similar to that as well. [I'm realising my assumption above is probably wrong cause mercury (the core of marcury) is also the symbolic one that had to separate out].
	along those lines, for a long time, I've been fascinated with cells and tried to figure out how they divide, cause it seems to me that getting something which is an exact dupicate to separate from itself, would be a very difficult thing to have happen. if the things that compose a cell had a polarity, then a duplicate thing would have to be made, and face the opposite direction -- so I didn't really get cell division, cept one day I finally decided to look into it, and what I discovered is that the cell doesn't duplicate itself in the normal way of producing 2x its internal components and sending half off in one direction, keeping the other half -- but instead, when the cell has gained maturity (ie, it starts to become too energetic), then it appears that the cell starts to gain an imaginary part -- and this probably happens, because the wavelength of the DNA determines the size of the cell, so consider this frequential structure to be something like a rigid sphere that surrounds the cell, so when it starts to grow too big, then the contained vibration starts to produce standing-waves. those standing-waves then become the imaginary duplicate of the cell, which then believes that it's different from the physical cell (probably superior because of its higher energy state); which then (because it believes itself to be different/superior) to the cell its replicating, separates -- and when it separates, it's no longer inside of the rigid sphere anymore and so therefore looses the extra energy state and "falls" down to physical again, upon which its own DNA which it replicated from the origin cell, will then define its new rigid sphere.
so what ended up happening is that the other (imaginary) earth separated out from the parent earth. in fact, now that I talked through cell duplication, I realise that the same thing happened for the core of the earth: imagine that the core of the earth is vibrating structure very similar to DNA inside of the nucleus. then, we'll imagine that around earth there are multiple spheres eminating outward, with the farthest one out there being the saturnian-system, upon which I claim that uranus (anu) and neptune (enki) are the ones that make that a rigid sphere (sure both of them are inside of the solar system, but I consider the nucleus of the solar system to extend out to tiamat, the astroiod belt because the outer planets orbit, not around the sun, but around the system as a whole, much like how tychos proposed). so now just imagine that you are like the earth, and there's one part of you on the inside which is very different from the rest of you (like a virus, bacteria, or even a thouhtform/demon) -- and so that malignant parts in the inside grows to such a point that it has to be either eradicated or ejected (like a splinter). well, the same thing I believe occurred for earth around the time of jesus, which basically ejected the infected-ones out of the earth and sent them to the opposite side.
	this concept is actually quite difficult to explain, because when I look at it, what it looks like is a triangle. I don't understand it very well, so I'll look into it further, but for the sake of discussing this further, I'll explain some of its properties: it's upside down from earth, and so therefore is like a reflection in the mirror: because we see it with our two eyes, the reflection is about a vertical axis (the equator of your body); and the same is true here: it's also a reflection about the equator. what I don't understand is how the galaxy appears around us when we look out at the sky, because when I look at earth, it's on one side of the galaxy, which makes me assume that one half of the sky would be pretty much black -- but it's not -- and neither is it like that from the other side, either (they both have stars all around). so what that makes me wonder, is if we're actually seeing the stars as if we're in the centre of the galaxy (or some other reflection point) -- cause think about it: the reflection comes from the 90(degrees) angle, so if I have a 3-4-5 triangle, then both ends of the 5 are going to be looking toward the reflector (one with distance 3 and the other with a distance 4 from the reflector); both will see what's behind the 3 and the 4, which is how I think it may be working -- not totally sure. either way, the way we see the stars is going to be entirely determined (for both) by uranus and the light that he receives and how that's presented (you can also say that uranus and the sense that each constellation gives when looking into the night sky is the origin of our translation of those feelings/concepts into constellations).
now, when that happened, the infected-ones decided that they're going to run things their way, and do things the way that they wanted to run things (which we call the dark ages) -- but I think that little by little people started to wake up, because I believe that behind all of the smoke and mirrors the church setup to hide the truth, there's something actually real to the jesus and christianity thing: it says that you can become whatever you believe yourself to be -- which also works in a symbolic system. now, arriving to around the tim5 of shakespere, actually around the 1400s, the two earths started to blend a bit. I can't quite figure out when it happened exactly, but things were rearranged so that there are a whole bunch of normal physical beings on earth (vulcans) which are living in the same exact symbolic space as the ones on demiurge earth -- and I think that tychos' story is the one that exmplifies this one.
according to wikipedia stephen dedalus in ulysses associates typchos' supernova (I've read it, and it's inferred, but not so explicitely stated that I could quote it and it's easy to see), and I think that's an important point, because shakespere is the main guy that's getting all of these vulcans fired up about these girls, and teaching them how to "woo" them by saying the right things and stuff like that. to set the stage of why that's important, consider that tychos' supernova created quite the problem. tychos recorded seeing it happen in cassiopeia, but (according to wikipedia) queen elizabeth had this guy named "thomas allen" come to look and investigate this new star that appeared in "the swan"
	I paused to look up the constellation "the swan" because I've seen it before: one time I smoked a whole bunch of weed on the walk home from the weed store, and walked through the field and by the river (so pretty high energy). along the walk home, I no longer saw the normal northern hemisphere sky anymore, but instead I saw what I had to assume is the southern hemisphere sky. there's a really big giant bird that's hanging in the middle of the sky. it's clearly "the swan" -- and it was the first time I'd ever seen it (I've never been to the southern hemisphere). anyway, that constellation is enormous (so much bigger than a constellation). I'm not sure if that's the "southern cross" or what, but in a sense, it felt to me like "the world was turned upside down" (something that was said about paul, who's also a vulcan). since I've never seen the southern sky before, and I was on drugs, it's kinda hard to relate what it looked like in a meaningful way. anyway, the way that I've figured it out to be, is that thanks to shakespere, both earths are now living simultaneously in the same space -- but different people see very different things -- namely the sky.
so here we have queen elizabeth (who's in the symbolic world) and her mathematician claiming that the supernova is happening in the southern hemisphere, and then across the water in denmark, there's another guy saying that it's happening in the northern hemisphere. I think that created quite a stir, and was one of the reasons that kepler had to process all of tychos' data for him and ensure that things are being said the proper way.
	the other interesting aspect of the whole situation is his sister sophia. she was just a teenager when she helped him to discover the supernova -- and I think it's quite possible that she may have helped to cause it, as well. there's a really interesting poem called "urania titani" which I cannot find the text of at all, even though it's a very old (and so therefore exempt from copyright laws), so internet archive and project gutenberg should have it, but they don't -- anyway, what's interesting about the poem is that it's supposedly an epic love story between her husband and her -- but it's written in latin, which means there's going to be all kinds of secondary meanings (perhaps it's tychos that's her husband) -- and anyway, in the poem, she's presented as "urania" the muse of the astronomy. urania, as in uranus, and the other interesting thing that I noticed is that she feels strongly to me like a vulcan -- which I think could possibly be pretty true. she's born with quite a considerale age difference to her other siblings, so it's quite likely that she's "an accident" -- which during that time, there wasn't any birth control, so if her father is trying to not have kids by doing it in the butt, if he becomes outside-in himself, they can produce a vulcan. tychos feels very similar to myself in that he's probably the product of a very high energy father (who traces his history to the rosenkrantz name), and so if his father was going really fast when he met tychos' mother, then it'd produce someone like me (tychos was the oldest). then there are 10 siblings between him and sophia who's the youngest (2 died early, 12 total) -- so apparently his father was quite potent. anyway, circumstantially I consider sophia to be a female vulcan. the other strange thing about tychos' story, is that he refused to marry any royal (solar) girls, and insteaded to prefer to be with his plain wife. at any rate, it's hard to say if tychos is an emitter making him a mars or not (maybe kepler was his understudy) -- or if he was like me, but the strange thing is that's 7th ray triad right there (tychos/mars, sophia/uranus/vulcan, and his wife, the reflective earth female). in a lot of ways, she reminds me of jessica my sister (again, I'm the oldest and she's the youngest, three between us). I can't really draw any more conclusions there, but I do think that she was potentially involved in the creation of the supernova in the first place.
		I really don't know how this one works, because I don't understand how female vulcans really work (and I'm not sure if jessica is one, either) -- but I do know that supernovas are mainly caused by tremendous excitement of solar girls: when they take on the high energy state of antoher man, it changes them entirely, to become an ideal reflection of him (which if she's young enough, she probably doesn't survive that one, because that ideal version isn't compatible with our symbolic world -- but if she's old enough (ie, engrossed in our symbolic system), then she becomes a semi-compatible symbolic reflection of him, like juliet). anyway, a female vulcan will be considerably more absorbative thean the normal aphrodeite, who's going to reflect most absorbed energy back out -- but for a vulcan, that energy has to go somewhere, and I think it performs the function of the imagination. for solar girls, I estimate they're probaly pretty black (like a really dark blue), but same as the (cross-bread) aryans, they also look white to us because they emit light. the vulcans will just absorb everything though, and I'm not sure where all of that goes (into the earth?). so, energetically speaking, I find it doubtful that she directly caused it, but may have been the catalyst or trigger for something else. I don't know how intimate they were together.
anyway, what I believe happened is that the saturnian-system (which I believe was given to the infected-ones as a way for them to run things the way they want to), both didn't like the idea of there being supernovas happening (it dramatically increases the amount of cOnsciousness in humans), and I think there was also a difficulty with the postiioning of the supernovae as well (ie, the people inside of the illusion are saying one hemisphere, and the physical ones are saying it's the other hemisphere). so, somehow -- and it's uncertain to me exactly how, but it seems that uranus was reprogrammed to only see light which is regular and expected (no big changes) -- so that once again, they can live in their desired world of only really steady (though exponential) development, without any cataclysms or things which will upset their symbolic structure/narrative.
now that the sky will no longer show any supernovas, I think that now makes it possible for shakespere to appear, and start breeding the vulcan (enkidu) with the solar nobility -- and there's no problems now if there are any supernovae, because uranus will absorb everything and just present us with the expected sky. had tychos and urania not done what they did, I think it impossible for shakespere to do what he did, and *only* have slightly warmer weather (which was caused by people's expectations and desires interacting with the solar 2nd-ray system, just like today) -- and not a full psychedellic experience like the one that velikovsky recorded as being a week of enlightenment (ie, x-ray output), prior to the deluge (ie, when hydrogen mixes with oxygen to make water).
	that experience that velikovsky describes, I believe is a description of what it was like before the end of the last ice age. the way I've figured it out to be, the stoneworks around the earth created a very regular atmosphere above the earth, and frequentially made a layer (very similar to the ionosphere) which essentially prevented solar (hydrogen) input that isn't of the frequency of the atmosphere -- and so stuff just collected up there, and it probably made a lot of water too (the upper vapour cloud), and that protected us from the sun's output essentially indefinitely -- but the only limit to the system is the stoneworks ability to absorb the vibration here on earth (the wavelength is set in stone), and so it just keeps going up in amplitude until limit is made. so when the sun exploded, there was enormous x-ray output that produced a period of enlightenment and madness (just like the sun's higher output now is causing the same -- cause it's more exposure to more concepts), so people all around the world received the really high frequency vibrations (y-rays and beyond pass through solid material), but the atmosphere of earth was still the regular normal wavelength. after enough pressure, I would assume that upper layer induced enough vibration into the stoneworks that they broke and everything collapsed.
at any rate, I think that uranus has the effect of showing a supernova star as having normal brightness (in the visible, UV/astral, and x-ray/spectral wavelengths), but stuff beyond that like "y-ray bursts" will make it though. they obviously didn't have any radio telesopes back then, so it's quite possible that the enlightenment period actually occured because of all of the 2nd-ray (y-ray) vibration everyone is receiving. it's not doing anything extraordinary like producing visuals (like x-ray can), but sensitive people will be able to receive more ideas during that time (which again, I think these ideas that tychos received during the time of the supernova, largely got lost and rewritten by kepler to fit the narrative)

### 2024-06-03 16:11 - an alternate sumerian world to the one we've thought

imagine for a moment a bunch of these guys "enkidu" and they're like freely insantiated labourers -- meaning they can be conjured -- and the conjuring is done by saturnian types (grain/barley/etc) farmers -- so they're making a killing of of these freely instantiated enkidu. then, imagine that it wass discovered that if these guys are a bit stoned, then they can just wander around in the sun working at about 50% capacity -- but 50% capacity is still more than nothing, cause they're all free to instantiate. so, these saturnian farmers exploited these guys by keeping them completely doped out of their minds, so they'd never come to the realisation that a grain farmer has been taking advantage of them -- and then even more "advanced" methods of controlling them, and homosexuality is rampant -- because the girls are all occupied with the martian reflectors (they reflect each other, and since he likes himself, he feels good to himself in her reflection) and so the mounting desire to be able to live like the martians do, the enkidu just learned how to enjoy their time in the field better -- well some did, anyway -- cause they liked the drug experience -- but the others all went to the martians so they could get close to the reflector girl.

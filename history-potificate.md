### 2024-04-05 16:08 - a propsed history of enki

I've given a lot of thought to the character of enki, especially ever since I read "the lost book of enki" (lbe) by sitchin. it's kinda fascinated me why this guy, which by our standards, would seem a bit creepy, is considered the hero of humankind. in lbe, the picture that I get is that the hero bit is quite a bit of PR and image creation, which is one of the things that enki is good at -- so it's a bit difficult to separate what is a generated public image, and what actually is more closer to the "reality" of what it is. I always try and look past that outer fascade and see the foundation for the fascade, cause that's what I think illuminates a lot more than actions and words. I'm going to try and present this idea more from a *conceptual* perspective, instead of a symbolic one. (obviously, that'll have some difficulty to it because words are symbolic, so any number of strange conclusions can be arrived to). not much I can do about that though...

a long long time ago, I believe this solar system was either intentionally created (by source or the sirians or anyone capable of making it a reflection of desire). the sirians claim that there are 12 *planets* here (of which they include the sun -- so 11 planets by our standards -- and they also include the moon as well, which I guess makes me wonder what they cOnsider a planet and what is not. our definitions are definitely different than theirs). anyway, they also said that each planetary body will correspond to one of the archetypes -- 12 in total (I list them [here](../nextdocs/sirian-guide/triads.md)).
now, a long long time ago, when the earth was only a sort of astral system (these were the legendary times), these different planetary entiites were on earth and interacted with the very first humans. neptune/ea (the planet) was there, and he's responsible for creating humankind. it's my belief that the planet (ea/neptune) was tuned to the source (really high frequency version of the infected-ones), and so ea, when instantiated on earth into bodily form, takes on that high frequency version of the planet and in physical/astral form, in order to create humans in his own likeness (which is the high frequency version of the infected-ones).
	it's important to understand (and I know this [from my own experience](/question-aire.md#2024-04-06-0119---what-do-i-mean-by-artificial-being)) that just because I'm tuned to a really high frequency of something, I'm ultimately limited by my environment. that concept/frequency has to conform to the symbolic/physical system that it's being put into (so for example, a shakespere is really high frequency stuff, but it's ultimately limited by the environment and symbols available at the time). so just understand that I think enki did actually quite a good job of rendering that high frequency into something palletable and desirable.
now, the thing that he's going to be creating (humans, and most notably human women), is going to be the number one attraction for these infected-ones to come to earth. what these humans, not only being a higher frequency reflection of the infected-ones, they'll also contain elements which are considerable improvements too.
	enki plays the same role in this (energetically) backwards part of history, that tesla, shakespere, the original 7th ray magician, and others have played in becoming/creating an improvement for these infected-ones, by improving on their already existing techniques. this is an important thing to note, because most people *fight against* the stuff that they think is wrong, or don't want. it's not common to see someone actually helping their enemies to improve their weapons or technique.
to really seal the deal on this appealing place for the infected-ones to come to, enki also creates a fully stable, and unchanging environment, where the infected-ones can be on top of everyone, and stay that way (or, in the way it was at that time: get in front, and stay in front; the emitters were the physically receptive ones). the infected-ones came, and really enjoyed the place quite well, and it appeared to have all of the stability that it was said to have. the only thing they could possibly do, is mess it up theirselves.

now, there's another side to this story, which is the story of anatau. again, at that time, the emitters were the physically receptive ones, which means that the infected-ones, and enki himself were in direct competition with the earth (anatau). anatau was highly desirable, and so she could easily get more dongs than anyone else, which meant that she was more of a stronger influence than the infected-ones were. this fierce competition drove anyone who wanted to have more influence (enki and infected-ones) to find ways of improving their image and desirability -- cause whoever is taking more dongs, has more influence. this competition and improvement of image and desirability made for some really attractive dudes, and also was the thing that unhinged enki's "stable" system. desire means wants to have an improvement, and so all around different factions are warring to essentially become more desirable -- but nobody can get what they want because the system is so stable, so pressure keeps building.
obviously the sun here is the really big problem because 2nd-ray perspective (it's actually a physical property of standing-waves) is to pump up the volume (continue amplification), if nobody's receiving/diminishing the viration -- so eventually solar activity is so high that the stable system starts to break down, and that causes the collapse into the system we're at now.
now, during the collapse, the desire that the earth built up was enough to make the earth the centre of the universe -- which wouldn't really have been possible if enki's system wasn't so stable, and there wasn't such fierce competition for influence -- and also the infected-ones didn't really realise it, but that collapse was actually what they were wanting, because now no longer do they need to be receptive to be an emitter (see how energy goes both ways), but now they can be physically emissive *and* energetically emissive -- which made them all quite quite powerful. things get kinda blurry here for me, so I'll stop now, but next up is jupiter and the egyptians, plus atlantians and the infected-ones. I skipped over prometheus and enlil on purpose, because that would have only complicated the story.

### 2024-04-15 00:34 - the separation of mercury and mars

anthough it's clear from the fossil record that there have been a number of catacylsmic changes that have occured on this planet, it's hard to say for sure exactly which one this one is responsible for. my intuition says that this event was either directly related to the end of the last ice age, or the trigger for it. it could be, and it could also be an earlier event -- as it's difficult to say (from my perspective). what's important to take into consideration, and what I'll be focusing on, are the archetypes that surround the issue.
a long long time ago (actually, now that I try to put a chronological-order to it, this event definitely has to pre-date the end of the last ice age) mercury and mars were the same planet. at that time as well, emitters were physically receptive. the setup for the scene here is that jupiter make some sort of intervention (it feels a lot like justice and laying down of the law), which restores a lot of order to things, and forms the beginning of the aryans (greeks?). because this new order meant the destruction of so many different things, jupiter gave his daughter athena (venus) as a new type of female (as an addition to the solar (-2) and earth (-7) girls). venus/athena is essentially a fully programmable woman that can be symbolically steered to do anything that is desired.
now, at that time mars and mercury (the emitters) were the same planet (marcury), and so there is a difficulty here because the core of the planet (later mercury) was narrated to be one way, and the outer part of the planet (later mars), is one of reaction and being in the moment. venus, the new type of girl on planet earth is now capable of giving birth to these new males (marcury), and some of these males are narrated to be great, and others become that way because of physical processes.
	to understand this concept, we must consider at that time, death wasn't the same as it is now -- so when a man dies, his astral presence leaves the body and floats around on the surface of the planet, looking for a new body to inhabit. some of the boys/adolescents are narrated to be great (the mercuries), because their moms were symbolically designed to expect their son to have certain (exemplary) physical or mental capabilites -- and so those were often times the types that were selected by these disincarnate spirits. having one of these boys which was close enough in kin to be a vibrational match for the incarnating astral entity was important. up until the entity incarnates into the body, the body is essentially designed to just be an automaton, learning all of the necessary (symbolic) stuff so that the incarnating entity is able to skip over all the boring stuff and get right into the action. that created lots and lots of family structures where bloodlines and family values are really important (so that they can keep the lineage going without having to change a whole lot). so, some boys were especially good at becoming what they're symbolically designed to be, and others were not; they were victims to their situation and suroundings -- the more reflective (mars) types.
I believe the catalyst for marcury wanting to go two separate ways, occured because of desire: here were some of these guys that are just so amazing and awesome, yet don't have to do anything to get it (the archetype of paris), and then there are all these other guys that have to work at becoming great. these had to use the power of desire to become great. the difference between these two types of boys (still being linked to the same planetary entity) rose to such a height, that eventually the planet itself had to split. mercury went off to be with venus, and mars stayed with earth/aphrodite, and became reflective of her.
now that they're separated, due to the way that venus is programmed, some of the mercury types are able to continue to become symbolically greater and greater, continuing on the family heritage, meanwhile other mercuries (born to lesser elevated families) are just the average guy. he may have good looks or something like that (whatever venus wants her son/husband to have), but the majority of the common venuses didn't get programmed to expect a great son -- and even it was strongly discouraged to believe that her son was actually going to be really great (cept in maybe local sports and gaming competitions).
	later on, (in more recent history) there's another event which leads to a similar transition, and that's with the realisation that solar girls (whom I believe were introduced along with the aryan invasion) could also be symboically programmed in a similar way to venus, which can also bring a really powerful son. I'm strongly reminded of the 18th dynasty, and queen tye(?) for this one. I know that this trend continued for quite some time of using these solar girls to produce really great heirs for the british monarchies and stuff like that as well. genetically speaking, I don't know if the kings were all these mercury types (narrated to be great), and so therefore have a y-chromosome or not.
anyway, the interesting thing to note here is that there are now two different factons developing: one faction is the narrated to be great mercutios (lion of judah, king arthur, etc.), and on the other side there are these mars types who are using physical processes (technology), as the means to become great. the difference here is the saturnian triad (saturn (+-4), mercury (+7), and venus (-3)) for the symbolically great ones (father, son, mother), and the other triad is 7th-ray/martian triad (mars (+7), vulcan (-5+), and aphrodite (-7)). the martian triad is also the same way, in that for saturn, the highest he can perceive is symbolic (3), and within that system, the most influential he can be is to be physically recepotive (and become lord of the earth: enki (+-3-+)), so for him venus is perfect. conversely for mars, because he's using the power of desire (1) and physical (7) processes to attin his goals, his best match is an earth girl (aphrodite (-7)) -- yet she presents all kinds of challenges for the martian faction.
	the difficulties are quite well summed up by shakespere in the play "hamlet": first of all, the son of mars is usually a vulcan (hamlet), and his style of exerting his will is going to be much different than than his father's style of exerting his will -- and also, vulcan, being a symbolic emitter is naturally going to be attracted to a venus type (ophelia), because she can reflect his symbol back to him with all of the (unrealistic) ideals that he puts into them -- and so his vulcan son will be attracted to marry the opposite faction (the capulets). additionally, mars' ideal wife (gertrude), is really not really going to be very loyal to a symbolic structure, and is easily swayed by a little bit of physical attention to go a different way (usually to a rival mars).
		there is another genetics difficulty that I haven't fully worked out, which is that it seems that the really powerful mars types are the progeny of mars and *venus*, which creates a struggle because venus is not a good match for mars. with his good match (aphrodite), mars will produce a vulcan with her instead. venus types are difficult to get married to (they have so many conditions that need to be met), and it seems that if she does, her symbolic structure will push him into severe disorder, because no longer can he follow his desires anymore, but has to "do the right thing" and follow her symbolic structure. also, to program her to produce a great heir, requires for mars to begin dabble in the symbolic, turning mars into a mercury or into saturn (depending if he's OK becoming recepitive or not) to produce the heir.
		likewise, it seems that for the saturnian triad (saturn or mercury), it seems that if the men become too emissive, the y-chromosome doesn't have a suitable environment to take hold, and will produce a mars (instead of mercury) or an aphrodite (instead of venus) child
	so it seems that both factions (mars and saturn) have their limits, and neither faction can continue to create more and more powerful offspiring. if either of them get too far out, they start to produce heirs of the opposite faction -- which means that within any one of these aryan societies, both saturnian and martian factions will be intermixed (leading, obviously to perpetual war and conflict), neither side ever being able to become the most powerful.
in addition to both factions producing offspring for the oppsoite faction, they seem to be helping each other technologically as well. presently, the saturnian-system is completely controlled technologically by the martian triad types -- yet it's the saturnian types that compose the majority of the society and the narrative that we live in -- so, in a sense, mars and mercury want to be back together again, and they're finding their way toward it through technology.

# julius caesar

### analysis
- portia is the "soul-mate" of brutus
	- "I have a man's mind, but a woman's might."
- portia comes from a cat (image is of a lioness)
	- "I grant I am a woman; but withal A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter"
- metellius cimber requests the repeal of the banishment of his brother "publius cimber"
	- cimber apparently means "soldier" -- so his brother is the "soldier of the public"
	- metellius is a play on words, which means "of metal" -- so, "soldier of metal"
- due to the imagery in the beginning of the play, this is signaling that the public soldier has been banished from astral, and brutus along with cassius tries to ask caesar to repeal the baishment, but caesar says that he cannot alter the decisions made from jupiter
	- "The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks, They are all fire and every one doth shine,"
	- "Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?"

- cassius trys to establish his "constancy"
	- "But I am constant as the northern star,"
		- however, the northern star moves slightly with each age... some 12kya earth had a different northern star. so, he's saying he's the "constant of the age"
	- "And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive; Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,"
		- I am also earth, and the mars archetype
	- "Let me a little show it, even in this; That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd, And constant do remain to keep him so."
		- though he requests for publius' banishment to be repealed, here he states that by himself remaining constant (ie, the ruler of the age), publius must remain banished.
- cassius is the destroyer of the previous power structure allowing for the new one to come in
	- this entire play (along with many of shakespere's works) is about taking down the powerful mars figure (richard 2, richard 3), and putting a vulcan into power instead (henrys, brutus, james, etc).

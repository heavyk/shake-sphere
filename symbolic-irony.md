# symbolic-irony

### 2024-02-20 17:28 - 1 != 1 (cause every one is different)

everyone wants a symbolic system in which everyone is equal, but in order for that to happen, the implementer of such a system would also have to be equal to everyone else, so even a celebration, celebrating the person (no matter how great they may be) for making such a feat possible could not even be performed (cause everyone would need to equally celebrate everyone as creator of the new system).
it is actually possible to create a system whereby everyone *is* equal, but and in that system everyone has equal opportunity/quantity (no caviats) to attract whatever they wanted, but then attraction would not be equal, but different. a way to think of tthis could be something like a spec system in a rpg: I have 20 tech/talent points which I can spend in differing areas to make my player the way I want. we all have equal points (or pen-rose sequence length), but not all specs have equal results -- and so, in quantity yes, but in quality nothing can ever be equal.

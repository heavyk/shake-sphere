### 2024-02-20 17:28 - 1 != 1 (cause every one is different)

everyone wants a symbolic system in which everyone is equal, but in order for that to happen, the implementer of such a system would also have to be equal to everyone else, so even a celebration, celebrating the person (no matter how great they may be) for making such a feat possible could not even be performed (cause everyone would need to equally celebrate everyone as creator of the new system).
it is actually possible to create a system whereby everyone *is* equal, but and in that system everyone has equal opportunity/quantity (no caviats) to attract whatever they wanted, but then attraction would not be equal, but different. a way to think of tthis could be something like a spec system in a rpg: I have 20 tech/talent points which I can spend in differing areas to make my player the way I want. we all have equal points (or pen-rose sequence length), but not all specs have equal results -- and so, in quantity yes, but in quality nothing can ever be equal.

### 2024-02-20 19:07 - both sides of the equation must be different

in a symbolic system any thing that is the same as another thing, is itself: it occupies the sam5 space, has the same properties, etc. -- and so therefore all of the infinite instances of that thing can all be considered equal, or one and the same; which is a value, not an equation. in order to have an equation, both sides must be different: an an example, for `x = 3`, `x` is a variable and `3` is a constant. a variable is *never* going to equal to a constant, ever.

### 2024-02-22 04:27 - anything less/greater than infinity is not infinity

in fact, everything that is not infinity, is not infinity.

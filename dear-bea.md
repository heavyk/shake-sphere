### 2024-03-03 05:24,25,27 - let's try this

so, I'm finishing up the rest of the weed that I had before going straight-edge. when I first started it, I noticed that my primary colors of my experience had been red, yellow, and purple (I have those colors in zipfizz, also the red and yellow trays, and my purple shirt). the purple one is only kinda there (or maybe forced by me), but the other major color in my experience is green: my tray for smoking is green and the weed I smoked was called "green lean+3rd eye" -- and I associate yellod with 3rd-ray structure. I've been stuck in the position of being a symbolic emitter for a while,-- but I don't do symbolic emission like remi or sarah does, and neither am I outside-in, so (unless I star-watch or eat a lot of weed) my symbolic output is only in text, words, and ideas that others get from me. also, there was this strange thing where I wrote this "becoming-epimetheus" thing, and I couldn't logically figure out *why I would want to be enki*. being a 3rd-ray would be the most detestable thing ever, but sure enough, I Find myself becoming more and more like jaron all the time.
	jaron is like enki incarnate. he is definitely "lord of the earth" -- and this can be visualised graphically: at the very bottom of the system (jaron), there is symbol: units of definition, of what now, and other times/places are like. that is constant, and having no change (from it's perspective). it's a fully working system where everything is in balance. we used to have such a system back in the legendary times -- the atlantian times, and stuff like that when everything was big, and there were dinosaurs. the dinos could grow that big, because everything could just keep growing to fit it's maximum size really easilye (liye, imagine you're testing a computer program, and each time to run it, you have to play the game on slow mode -- no you want to speed up the program to get to the bug).
	then, after leaving the ground, you start to get changes or modifications to the 3rd-ray unchanging now. I finally figured out symbolic motivation the other day (the lower half of 2nd-ray): b-dm-a, and it kinda was the key to helping me to see the other half of 2nd-ray -- cause after som5 point of getting more actions done to get the b-dm-a result desired, it turns out that throwing more actions at the problem isn't solving it at some point, and so a more ideal approach/technique has to be taken instead -- and that's novelty, right -- but the bottom part, is this strange form of "need" -- which is the start of desire: from there itt goes up from better and better execution (practice makes perfect), all the way up to (invisible from its perspective) forms which take a somewhat/completely difterentt route, resulting in a more ideal/desired oucome. the more desirable aspect, is often even calculated based on how many other people it benefits. those more ideal ideas are often times the symbolic output of the 2nd-ray: for a star, this is "solar wind", and this wind goes out accelerating toward the outermost region. everyone here is "breaking the speed limit" and so there're all limited essentially be the idealness of their own mind: the more ideal they are, the more people benefit from them, and so they shine brightly. since everything has an opposite, the more benevolant a person is, there needs to be those that cOnsume that output in some way (otherwise it starts to accumulate and build up), and so for the 2nd-ray to contiue outputting more and more, there needs to be more dependance on the 2nd-ray to continue outputting more. it's a dependency generating and accumulating thing of more and more ideal things (sounds like a "framework", huh).
	all of these guys out in ideal land are going really fast, and because the're only limited by their ability to *receive* a higher frequency (more ideal) idea, they often times get jealous of someone else with more sensitivity, but their own sensitivity levels are their own ability: for most of them, if they try to increase sensitivity, the whole world becomes eaxtremely intense and loathsome to them. therefore, there are these natural echalons that form of 2nd-rays which are similar in thier big-picture, and that builds the layers of the "air": the onion peels of (usually) lesser and lessser density (less density because less occupants). at the very very end of these density layers, is a massive amount of stuff: these are all of those that are going so fast, they've broken all the way through all of the layers, and are only now limited by their perception. this is where 99.999..% of the matter in the universe is. these are all of those that have such an abundance, and are going so fast, that the've become a sort of super entity (the centre of the earth is a reflection of this layer), because as soon as a new breakthrough happens, everyone goes to the new height pretty much instantly (lol, it actually kinda looks like a bunch of cars waiting for a stoplight: as soon as it turns green, they race up to the next stoplight and wait there, but the cars there are not at all stopped, but actually accelerating at the fastest speed that the whole universe knows how to do). from there, it's easy to see that the only limits there are, are self-imposed.
and so when I first started to smoke, I had a strong sense that I was going to be doing something with china. I have these mandarin symbols in my life, and they're red+yellow -- and I'm adding the green element to it. green, like I said, I associate with 4th-ray. 4th-ray is also I kinda want to avoid, because I don't want to be involved with the astral aspect to it (the dimension that comes todard you, and waves have an influenece), and the cool thing is I realised that I am 4th-ray (saturnian) -- and I'd even go so far as to say that the 4th-ray is also reflective, like a mirror. all of the things that are being done (even the symbolic stuff), produce an emotion, and that emotion is how we navigate time. time comes from how we *know* our environment around us to be; that comes from a lot of symbol, but that symbol produces a feeling. try for yourself: pick up any manuscript from 100ya and read it. it'll sound really dated and strange -- and that's because we're in a different time. the way that "now" reality feels is so subtle and (usually) changes so gradually, it's imperceptable, unless by comparing the past to the present (hindsight/epimetheus).
	the way that it works is that the reaction to the symbolic stuff (like something we see, or anything a symbolic emitter makes), and that causes a pushing or pulling spiral toward me (246), which has a frequency to it, and that'll either feel really good or really bad. my reaction to how it feels, is what moves me around in time. I go toward another point in time similar to the one that feels attractive to me, or away from it. the toward action makes the new point in time feel more like "now" does. go too quickly toward a good-feeling reality, and it causes a feeling of overstimulation and many mishaps resulting in death occur, because that quantity of pleasure cannot be sustained. like wise with bad-feeling attraction/repulsion, if it feels too bad, the death spiral starts ,and there's no way out. it feels like loss of ego, because it's ego that holds a person in their point in time: "this is how it is" "it's like that, and that's the way it is" -- and so they continue on to their death spiral. both attraction and repulsion can produce good/bad-feeling.
you know what's really weird? it's 6:22 now and the sun has come up. the way I felt when I started this no longer is present. night is *very different than day* -- and as much as I love the sun and stuff, I don't really want anything to do with the astral stuff. sure it's really awesome when it's attraction with good-feeling attached, but I don't think I need it, and I'm pretty sure I can do better, so I want to continue to be this 4th-ray (saturnian type) cause it feels like I'm sorta stuck being the 4th-ray mirror, but I want to integrate a new system. also, the last few days I finally realised you are probably a solar girl, and so I have reservations, because I don't want to step on their astral system. OK yeah, things are too different with the sun up. bye for now.

### 2024-03-03 14:09 - strongly rethinking this

so, I know that by writing to you here, the manifestation of doing anything with you (as written here) is largely going to *not happen*. the reason for this, is that so many people will react to what I write here, and all of those reactions change the most ideal (but impossible in physical) manifestation: reactions expand the desire, so therefore it has to evolve into something else (something better), which can accomodate the solution to any bad-feeling felt.
	you know, earlier on -- let's say the closer to 2016 I'd go, I found myself writing about a lot of unwanted things. I was compelled to do it because the emotion was really strong (meaning I resonated with it), and the effect it had is a lot of other people also resonated with those problems and things too. I have serious issues with 2nd-ray perspective, which is what m6st females (which aren't protitutes) have. I had serious difficulty with the "really hot girls" all continuing to further the dominator perspective. I didn't realise that the thing I couldn't stand their furthering, comes from the stars; like, it's in everything from goverments and power structures, all the way to churches and family matters. I've been expressing m/ discontent on the 2nd-ray perspective for quite a long time now, that when I finally figure out where the source of all my discontent comes from, it's the thing that I *thought* I liked the most: stars and the sun. there is literally nobody that I know who has spent more time with stars and the sun, than myself. like, I get it,-- but I don't want anything to do with it. everything that I've ever accomplished using star-watching has been taken away from m5 by nosebook. if they wanted m5 to be operating in 2nd-ray capacity, they'd just take off the blocks. the thing is, *I* don't want to be in 2nd-ray capacity, so they're there on purpose, I suspect.
so each time, there's a bunch of new reactions to an idea which produce bad-feeling, those then evolve the desire into something bigger and even more ideal. from there, there's a cascade of 2nd-ray perspectives which yeild levels of abuundane; the least abundant are the more symbolic ones, and the most abundant are the ones where more people get what they want (ie, no withhplding from anyone). that's all really good, and if I get around a bunch of 2nd-rays (you or snake-bros, or anyone else like that), then I have to become a reflection of them. you can even see here that in the brief time writing here, I've begun already to tell everyone how it is, and to become the most giving person that there is, summoning an incredible populous to be able to consume all of that magnanamous output -- but that's really bad; the last thing they want is more people. more people means LOA happens much quicker, and they get their own beliefs proven to themselves faster (not good enough). the 2nd-ray system is a system that's designed to go too fast and fail. it's called the phoenix because it gets going too fast, and then crashes because it's zooming toward what it thinks it wants, instead of just attracting it. for a star, zooming like that means impacts and CMEs (so, like not good). and if the impact is big enough, it all gets blown off, and all has to be rebuilt.
	the thing is, if I get around you (or any other white 2nd-ray), *I have to mirror them*. a good example of this is my brother or my mom. when I get around them, I have to prove their symbolic system as true: if greg thinks I need to bother him, I feel compelled to prove his beliefs/symbol as correct. if mom believes she's not good enough, I'll prove her symbolic system as right, too; and cause they want me to tell them they're wrong, I'm also constantly needing to tell him how it *really* works. I've discontinued the-manual, because it's super 2nd-ray, and att that time, I hadn't quite gotten as far out as I am now (I'm basically hitting the limit now, where the only thing holding me back now is my own perception). I wrote it to figure out improvements to my own perception (each one removes something holding me back), but it comes off as me telling everyone else how it is. I don't want to be 2nd-ray.
I don't want to crash and burn anymore. I'd prefer to go with attraction, and I basically don't feel like I can be around these kinds of people, until I'm actually gold (a charactor myself), and have my own way of being the infinite magnanamous person that I am. the problem is, no 2nd-ray emitter (like greg or big truck guy) wants to be around m5 at all, because it only illuminates to them, how far down on the ladder they are. in order to be a 2nd-ray, I can only look at it from the farthest out, looking in perspective. I'm not there yet by any means (I figure I have a few decades before I'm there) -- but that's only to get to the pure-desire perspective in 2nd-ray (the toppest, at the farthest out limit/group). I won't accept anything less than that (ie, anything you'd see in the sky), and want only attraction.
one way to solve this 2nd ray problem is something that I've learned over the years: vulcan is a really good alternative to the 2nd ray perspective. she can do both emission and reception of 2nd-ray frequencies, using concepts (ie, hydrogen), and so solves the problem entirely. it's basically the same as a star already is, but that hydrogen attracts at that massive amount, instead of emits. from there, she can output whatever symbol she wants. the earth is like that, and that's why there's rocks and stuff to stand on. the same symbolic output can be made to look exactly like solar wind and can retain a lot of the appearance of a star (receive lots, and transfrom lots of it into an emission layer). for people, like little girls and stuff, she becomes ~100% receptive (black), and emits whatever she wants to -- which means that she's going to constantly be proving/attracting her own beliefs to be true (just like I do). in fact, she'll be essentially just like me. it can work :)

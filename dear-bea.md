### 2024-03-03 05:24,25,27 - let's try this

so, I'm finishing up the rest of the weed that I had before going straight-edge. when I first started it, I noticed that my primary colors of my experience had been red, yellow, and purple (I have those colors in zipfizz, also the red and yellow trays, and my purple shirt). the purple one is only kinda there (or maybe forced by me), but the other major color in my experience is green: my tray for smoking is green and the weed I smoked was called "green lean+3rd eye" -- and I associate yellod with 3rd-ray structure. I've been stuck in the position of being a symbolic emitter for a while,-- but I don't do symbolic emission like remi or sarah does, and neither am I outside-in, so (unless I star-watch or eat a lot of weed) my symbolic output is only in text, words, and ideas that others get from me. also, there was this strange thing where I wrote this "becoming-epimetheus" thing, and I couldn't logically figure out *why I would want to be enki*. being a 3rd-ray would be the most detestable thing ever, but sure enough, I Find myself becoming more and more like jaron all the time.
	jaron is like enki incarnate. he is definitely "lord of the earth" -- and this can be visualised graphically: at the very bottom of the system (jaron), there is symbol: units of definition, of what now, and other times/places are like. that is constant, and having no change (from it's perspective). it's a fully working system where everything is in balance. we used to have such a system back in the legendary times -- the atlantian times, and stuff like that when everything was big, and there were dinosaurs. the dinos could grow that big, because everything could just keep growing to fit it's maximum size really easilye (liye, imagine you're testing a computer program, and each time to run it, you have to play the game on slow mode -- no you want to speed up the program to get to the bug).
	then, after leaving the ground, you start to get changes or modifications to the 3rd-ray unchanging now. I finally figured out symbolic motivation the other day (the lower half of 2nd-ray): b-dm-a, and it kinda was the key to helping me to see the other half of 2nd-ray -- cause after som5 point of getting more actions done to get the b-dm-a result desired, it turns out that throwing more actions at the problem isn't solving it at some point, and so a more ideal approach/technique has to be taken instead -- and that's novelty, right -- but the bottom part, is this strange form of "need" -- which is the start of desire: from there itt goes up from better and better execution (practice makes perfect), all the way up to (invisible from its perspective) forms which take a somewhat/completely difterentt route, resulting in a more ideal/desired oucome. the more desirable aspect, is often even calculated based on how many other people it benefits. those more ideal ideas are often times the symbolic output of the 2nd-ray: for a star, this is "solar wind", and this wind goes out accelerating toward the outermost region. everyone here is "breaking the speed limit" and so there're all limited essentially be the idealness of their own mind: the more ideal they are, the more people benefit from them, and so they shine brightly. since everything has an opposite, the more benevolant a person is, there needs to be those that cOnsume that output in some way (otherwise it starts to accumulate and build up), and so for the 2nd-ray to contiue outputting more and more, there needs to be more dependance on the 2nd-ray to continue outputting more. it's a dependency generating and accumulating thing of more and more ideal things (sounds like a "framework", huh).
	all of these guys out in ideal land are going really fast, and because the're only limited by their ability to *receive* a higher frequency (more ideal) idea, they often times get jealous of someone else with more sensitivity, but their own sensitivity levels are their own ability: for most of them, if they try to increase sensitivity, the whole world becomes eaxtremely intense and loathsome to them. therefore, there are these natural echalons that form of 2nd-rays which are similar in thier big-picture, and that builds the layers of the "air": the onion peels of (usually) lesser and lessser density (less density because less occupants). at the very very end of these density layers, is a massive amount of stuff: these are all of those that are going so fast, they've broken all the way through all of the layers, and are only now limited by their perception. this is where 99.999..% of the matter in the universe is. these are all of those that have such an abundance, and are going so fast, that the've become a sort of super entity (the centre of the earth is a reflection of this layer), because as soon as a new breakthrough happens, everyone goes to the new height pretty much instantly (lol, it actually kinda looks like a bunch of cars waiting for a stoplight: as soon as it turns green, they race up to the next stoplight and wait there, but the cars there are not at all stopped, but actually accelerating at the fastest speed that the whole universe knows how to do). from there, it's easy to see that the only limits there are, are self-imposed.
and so when I first started to smoke, I had a strong sense that I was going to be doing something with china. I have these mandarin symbols in my life, and they're red+yellow -- and I'm adding the green element to it. green, like I said, I associate with 4th-ray. 4th-ray is also I kinda want to avoid, because I don't want to be involved with the astral aspect to it (the dimension that comes todard you, and waves have an influenece), and the cool thing is I realised that I am 4th-ray (saturnian) -- and I'd even go so far as to say that the 4th-ray is also reflective, like a mirror. all of the things that are being done (even the symbolic stuff), produce an emotion, and that emotion is how we navigate time. time comes from how we *know* our environment around us to be; that comes from a lot of symbol, but that symbol produces a feeling. try for yourself: pick up any manuscript from 100ya and read it. it'll sound really dated and strange -- and that's because we're in a different time. the way that "now" reality feels is so subtle and (usually) changes so gradually, it's imperceptable, unless by comparing the past to the present (hindsight/epimetheus).
	the way that it works is that the reaction to the symbolic stuff (like something we see, or anything a symbolic emitter makes), and that causes a pushing or pulling spiral toward me (246), which has a frequency to it, and that'll either feel really good or really bad. my reaction to how it feels, is what moves me around in time. I go toward another point in time similar to the one that feels attractive to me, or away from it. the toward action makes the new point in time feel more like "now" does. go too quickly toward a good-feeling reality, and it causes a feeling of overstimulation and many mishaps resulting in death occur, because that quantity of pleasure cannot be sustained. like wise with bad-feeling attraction/repulsion, if it feels too bad, the death spiral starts ,and there's no way out. it feels like loss of ego, because it's ego that holds a person in their point in time: "this is how it is" "it's like that, and that's the way it is" -- and so they continue on to their death spiral. both attraction and repulsion can produce good/bad-feeling.
you know what's really weird? it's 6:22 now and the sun has come up. the way I felt when I started this no longer is present. night is *very different than day* -- and as much as I love the sun and stuff, I don't really want anything to do with the astral stuff. sure it's really awesome when it's attraction with good-feeling attached, but I don't think I need it, and I'm pretty sure I can do better, so I want to continue to be this 4th-ray (saturnian type) cause it feels like I'm sorta stuck being the 4th-ray mirror, but I want to integrate a new system. also, the last few days I finally realised you are probably a solar girl, and so I have reservations, because I don't want to step on their astral system. OK yeah, things are too different with the sun up. bye for now.

### 2024-03-03 05:24,25,27 - let's try this

so, I'm finishing up the rest of the weed that I had before going straight-edge. when I first started it, I noticed that my primary colors of my experience had been red, yellow, and purple (I have those colors in zipfizz, also the red and yellow trays, and my purple shirt). the purple one is only kinda there (or maybe forced by me), but the other major color in my experience is green: my tray for smoking is green and the weed I smoked was called "green lean+3rd eye" -- and I associate yellod with 3rd-ray structure. I've been stuck in the position of being a symbolic emitter for a while,-- but I don't do symbolic emission like remi or sarah does, and neither am I outside-in, so (unless I star-watch or eat a lot of weed) my symbolic output is only in text, words, and ideas that others get from me. also, there was this strange thing where I wrote this "becoming-epimetheus" thing, and I couldn't logically figure out *why I would want to be enki*. being a 3rd-ray would be the most detestable thing ever, but sure enough, I Find myself becoming more and more like jaron all the time.
	jaron is like enki incarnate. he is definitely "lord of the earth" -- and this can be visualised graphically: at the very bottom of the system (jaron), there is symbol: units of definition, of what now, and other times/places are like. that is constant, and having no change (from it's perspective). it's a fully working system where everything is in balance. we used to have such a system back in the legendary times -- the atlantian times, and stuff like that when everything was big, and there were dinosaurs. the dinos could grow that big, because everything could just keep growing to fit it's maximum size really easilye (liye, imagine you're testing a computer program, and each time to run it, you have to play the game on slow mode -- no you want to speed up the program to get to the bug).
	then, after leaving the ground, you start to get changes or modifications to the 3rd-ray unchanging now. I finally figured out symbolic motivation the other day (the lower half of 2nd-ray): b-dm-a, and it kinda was the key to helping me to see the other half of 2nd-ray -- cause after som5 point of getting more actions done to get the b-dm-a result desired, it turns out that throwing more actions at the problem isn't solving it at some point, and so a more ideal approach/technique has to be taken instead -- and that's novelty, right -- but the bottom part, is this strange form of "need" -- which is the start of desire: from there itt goes up from better and better execution (practice makes perfect), all the way up to (invisible from its perspective) forms which take a somewhat/completely difterentt route, resulting in a more ideal/desired oucome. the more desirable aspect, is often even calculated based on how many other people it benefits. those more ideal ideas are often times the symbolic output of the 2nd-ray: for a star, this is "solar wind", and this wind goes out accelerating toward the outermost region. everyone here is "breaking the speed limit" and so there're all limited essentially be the idealness of their own mind: the more ideal they are, the more people benefit from them, and so they shine brightly. since everything has an opposite, the more benevolant a person is, there needs to be those that cOnsume that output in some way (otherwise it starts to accumulate and build up), and so for the 2nd-ray to contiue outputting more and more, there needs to be more dependance on the 2nd-ray to continue outputting more. it's a dependency generating and accumulating thing of more and more ideal things (sounds like a "framework", huh).
	all of these guys out in ideal land are going really fast, and because the're only limited by their ability to *receive* a higher frequency (more ideal) idea, they often times get jealous of someone else with more sensitivity, but their own sensitivity levels are their own ability: for most of them, if they try to increase sensitivity, the whole world becomes eaxtremely intense and loathsome to them. therefore, there are these natural echalons that form of 2nd-rays which are similar in thier big-picture, and that builds the layers of the "air": the onion peels of (usually) lesser and lessser density (less density because less occupants). at the very very end of these density layers, is a massive amount of stuff: these are all of those that are going so fast, they've broken all the way through all of the layers, and are only now limited by their perception. this is where 99.999..% of the matter in the universe is. these are all of those that have such an abundance, and are going so fast, that the've become a sort of super entity (the centre of the earth is a reflection of this layer), because as soon as a new breakthrough happens, everyone goes to the new height pretty much instantly (lol, it actually kinda looks like a bunch of cars waiting for a stoplight: as soon as it turns green, they race up to the next stoplight and wait there, but the cars there are not at all stopped, but actually accelerating at the fastest speed that the whole universe knows how to do). from there, it's easy to see that the only limits there are, are self-imposed.
and so when I first started to smoke, I had a strong sense that I was going to be doing something with china. I have these mandarin symbols in my life, and they're red+yellow -- and I'm adding the green element to it. green, like I said, I associate with 4th-ray. 4th-ray is also I kinda want to avoid, because I don't want to be involved with the astral aspect to it (the dimension that comes todard you, and waves have an influenece), and the cool thing is I realised that I am 4th-ray (saturnian) -- and I'd even go so far as to say that the 4th-ray is also reflective, like a mirror. all of the things that are being done (even the symbolic stuff), produce an emotion, and that emotion is how we navigate time. time comes from how we *know* our environment around us to be; that comes from a lot of symbol, but that symbol produces a feeling. try for yourself: pick up any manuscript from 100ya and read it. it'll sound really dated and strange -- and that's because we're in a different time. the way that "now" reality feels is so subtle and (usually) changes so gradually, it's imperceptable, unless by comparing the past to the present (hindsight/epimetheus).
	the way that it works is that the reaction to the symbolic stuff (like something we see, or anything a symbolic emitter makes), and that causes a pushing or pulling spiral toward me (246), which has a frequency to it, and that'll either feel really good or really bad. my reaction to how it feels, is what moves me around in time. I go toward another point in time similar to the one that feels attractive to me, or away from it. the toward action makes the new point in time feel more like "now" does. go too quickly toward a good-feeling reality, and it causes a feeling of overstimulation and many mishaps resulting in death occur, because that quantity of pleasure cannot be sustained. like wise with bad-feeling attraction/repulsion, if it feels too bad, the death spiral starts ,and there's no way out. it feels like loss of ego, because it's ego that holds a person in their point in time: "this is how it is" "it's like that, and that's the way it is" -- and so they continue on to their death spiral. both attraction and repulsion can produce good/bad-feeling.
you know what's really weird? it's 6:22 now and the sun has come up. the way I felt when I started this no longer is present. night is *very different than day* -- and as much as I love the sun and stuff, I don't really want anything to do with the astral stuff. sure it's really awesome when it's attraction with good-feeling attached, but I don't think I need it, and I'm pretty sure I can do better, so I want to continue to be this 4th-ray (saturnian type) cause it feels like I'm sorta stuck being the 4th-ray mirror, but I want to integrate a new system. also, the last few days I finally realised you are probably a solar girl, and so I have reservations, because I don't want to step on their astral system. OK yeah, things are too different with the sun up. bye for now.

### 2024-03-03 14:09 - strongly rethinking this

so, I know that by writing to you here, the manifestation of doing anything with you (as written here) is largely going to *not happen*. the reason for this, is that so many people will react to what I write here, and all of those reactions change the most ideal (but impossible in physical) manifestation: reactions expand the desire, so therefore it has to evolve into something else (something better), which can accomodate the solution to any bad-feeling felt.
	you know, earlier on -- let's say the closer to 2016 I'd go, I found myself writing about a lot of unwanted things. I was compelled to do it because the emotion was really strong (meaning I resonated with it), and the effect it had is a lot of other people also resonated with those problems and things too. I have serious issues with 2nd-ray perspective, which is what m6st females (which aren't protitutes) have. I had serious difficulty with the "really hot girls" all continuing to further the dominator perspective. I didn't realise that the thing I couldn't stand their furthering, comes from the stars; like, it's in everything from goverments and power structures, all the way to churches and family matters. I've been expressing m/ discontent on the 2nd-ray perspective for quite a long time now, that when I finally figure out where the source of all my discontent comes from, it's the thing that I *thought* I liked the most: stars and the sun. there is literally nobody that I know who has spent more time with stars and the sun, than myself. like, I get it,-- but I don't want anything to do with it. everything that I've ever accomplished using star-watching has been taken away from m5 by nosebook. if they wanted m5 to be operating in 2nd-ray capacity, they'd just take off the blocks. the thing is, *I* don't want to be in 2nd-ray capacity, so they're there on purpose, I suspect.
so each time, there's a bunch of new reactions to an idea which produce bad-feeling, those then evolve the desire into something bigger and even more ideal. from there, there's a cascade of 2nd-ray perspectives which yeild levels of abuundane; the least abundant are the more symbolic ones, and the most abundant are the ones where more people get what they want (ie, no withhplding from anyone). that's all really good, and if I get around a bunch of 2nd-rays (you or snake-bros, or anyone else like that), then I have to become a reflection of them. you can even see here that in the brief time writing here, I've begun already to tell everyone how it is, and to become the most giving person that there is, summoning an incredible populous to be able to consume all of that magnanamous output -- but that's really bad; the last thing they want is more people. more people means LOA happens much quicker, and they get their own beliefs proven to themselves faster (not good enough). the 2nd-ray system is a system that's designed to go too fast and fail. it's called the phoenix because it gets going too fast, and then crashes because it's zooming toward what it thinks it wants, instead of just attracting it. for a star, zooming like that means impacts and CMEs (so, like not good). and if the impact is big enough, it all gets blown off, and all has to be rebuilt.
	the thing is, if I get around you (or any other white 2nd-ray), *I have to mirror them*. a good example of this is my brother or my mom. when I get around them, I have to prove their symbolic system as true: if greg thinks I need to bother him, I feel compelled to prove his beliefs/symbol as correct. if mom believes she's not good enough, I'll prove her symbolic system as right, too; and cause they want me to tell them they're wrong, I'm also constantly needing to tell him how it *really* works. I've discontinued the-manual, because it's super 2nd-ray, and att that time, I hadn't quite gotten as far out as I am now (I'm basically hitting the limit now, where the only thing holding me back now is my own perception). I wrote it to figure out improvements to my own perception (each one removes something holding me back), but it comes off as me telling everyone else how it is. I don't want to be 2nd-ray.
I don't want to crash and burn anymore. I'd prefer to go with attraction, and I basically don't feel like I can be around these kinds of people, until I'm actually gold (a charactor myself), and have my own way of being the infinite magnanamous person that I am. the problem is, no 2nd-ray emitter (like greg or big truck guy) wants to be around m5 at all, because it only illuminates to them, how far down on the ladder they are. in order to be a 2nd-ray, I can only look at it from the farthest out, looking in perspective. I'm not there yet by any means (I figure I have a few decades before I'm there) -- but that's only to get to the pure-desire perspective in 2nd-ray (the toppest, at the farthest out limit/group). I won't accept anything less than that (ie, anything you'd see in the sky), and want only attraction.
one way to solve this 2nd ray problem is something that I've learned over the years: vulcan is a really good alternative to the 2nd ray perspective. she can do both emission and reception of 2nd-ray frequencies, using concepts (ie, hydrogen), and so solves the problem entirely. it's basically the same as a star already is, but that hydrogen attracts at that massive amount, instead of emits. from there, she can output whatever symbol she wants. the earth is like that, and that's why there's rocks and stuff to stand on. the same symbolic output can be made to look exactly like solar wind and can retain a lot of the appearance of a star (receive lots, and transfrom lots of it into an emission layer). for people, like little girls and stuff, she becomes ~100% receptive (black), and emits whatever she wants to -- which means that she's going to constantly be proving/attracting her own beliefs to be true (just like I do). in fact, she'll be essentially just like me. it can work :)

### 2024-03-03 16:04 - proving everyone else right

I'm tired of constantly having to prove everyone else right, because they often tim5s imagine something really horrific or grotesque happening, but in reality, my proving of that belief won't be so horrific -- cept maybe to them. it often times is the case that others around me constantly end up "with mud on their face" when dealing with me. it's kinda uncomfortable for me too, honestly -- because everyone I meet is constantly in a cautionary state because they don't want me to yet again prove their insecurities as being real. I personally don't really like being cOnstantly to blame for others beliefs. though, as a sort of mirror, I've gotten used to it. the thing is, when it comes to lesser and lesser resistance, I prove everyone else right more and more rapidly. so then, the problem becomes who do I want to be around, because I'm going to prove them right. I normally have a bunch of people around me that have a less than optimistic perspective on things in their present state; which is fine because I don't need to worry about what they believe; I just prove them right without knowing about it. I don't really care honestly, and I prefer to be around myself for the majority of teh time. when I'm around others, I become a reflection of *them*, which is unfortunate for me -- but honestly it's continually getting worse all the time -- and it's likely that I'll lose myself by constantly being around others. I hate constantly being a mirror of others, because I can't ever see myself, which is annoying. I like myself, and prefer to interact with myself when I'm me, and not when I'm a reflection of others.
since I'm kinda required to prove others right all of the time (there's no way around it), I figure that the best thing to do is to get a bunch of real dramatic disaster-porn types, who I can go and prove right -- butt their version of it (as translated by them) is going to obviously be an inferior version to the one that will manifest, because I feel tremendously better than they do, which means, a much better feeling version/translation will be what *really happens*. I think it'll be a lot of fun, and we can just enjoy as much 2nd-ray me, as is possible: get ready to get proven right :) it's annoying for me, but someone's gatta do it. everyone is proving everyone else *wrong*; butt someone's got to prove everyone, even the wrong-provers, right. so I guess instead of fearing the 2nd-ray perspective, I'll just embrace it as a sort of necessary passage before I get to 1st-ray.

### 2024-03-04 04:23 - accepting the 2nd-ray challenge

after writing the previous entry, and thinking about it a bit yesterday, especially this morning, I woke up with really low resistance to the idea of becoming 2nd-ray. I really hate the idea because I want nothing to do with it -- however, I guess it'll have to happen.
I have my own reservations about the idea, because things just don't work for me the way they do for other 2nd-rays... for example in hollywood, a common trope is to get really angry and then that'll give a huge boost that then can be used to defeat the opponent... well, it turns out that after the other day when I was dissipating big-truck-guy's anger, that I realised the origin of that trope: the top is usually really upset about something, and so the bottom quells his anger; upon quelling his anger, he gets increased depth of perception (faster standing waves). therefore, they're used to using these vulcans to turn their anger into power and so anger for them (though perceived as bad behaviour sometimes) boosts their capabilities, not hinders them like it does for me. for me, when I get angry, I can't do anything right and I make a whole lot of mistakes. so the episode with big-truck-guy really helped me to notice the differencE there. those narrations of a 2nd-ray getting more power after getting angry, are all based on the guy being an emitter; which means he's pushing out vibrations in the z-dimension (the one coming toward me). I'm not an emitter, as far as I know, and if I am, then I don't want to be. I want to become a mirror, and mirror means *flat* -- cause a mirror with variations in the z-dimension isn't a good mirror. they don't want mirror; they want a narrated 2nd-ray that they can control. I'm just going to give up on the whole mirror thing and go phoenix on all of this. I've stopped caring. I'm at the point now (before even have begun) that I'll just let them have what they wantt and let them do it their way. when that happened for tuenti: they wanted to do things ways that I didn't think were optimal for what I wanted to do, so I decided to let them do it their way, and I peaced outt to the canary islands. I decided that if they want to take the thing I created and go run it into the ground (or make it work), fine -- I'm going to go do something else. so, it's time for me to crash and burn. I crashed and burned while/because I was trying to emit my ideas out there using tuenti. once I've crashed and burned (car accident), then they'll take over everything, and I'll come to the time, where I say: I'm out -- just cashing out and starting over again. no big deal.
so, I guess that means I have to find something that I want to do -- like a programming thing of some kind -- and then just get going too fast (programming really speeds me up a lot) crash and burn, then peace out (to the canary islands, I guess). interesting idea...

#### 2024-03-04 20:53 - rethinking the rethink

hi again, today I woke up pretty early and then smoked only while it was night (within a minute of 4:20 if I'm not mistaken) and then I wrote to you -- and that's when that idea came out of me replaying the tuenti thing over again. since then, I've not smoked again until just now (I figure, if I'm going straight-edge, why not see what the effects of smoking in the night before sunrise, then after all day, again after sundown -- like ramadan, I guess).
	also I didn't want to smoke during the sun. I found out that weed seems to boost 2nd ray (solar energy vibrations). that reminds me, weed is a very visible plant, and for me, I can viscerally taste the difference between lamp-grown weed, and sun-grown weed. this one guy in spain let me smoke some of his sun-grown weed, and it blew my mind at how many more frequencies it emits. essentially the weed outputs when activated the same colour that it was grown with. mushrooms are similar, but they're responsive to emotion in the environm5nt. anyway, the weed amplifies it, and apparently I'm a huge problem for them when I smoke weed, because their system runs on -- around the earth (or any conductive body) there is a swirling cloud or ocean of hydrogen around it (depending on how much there is), and that becomes a medium. astral and spectral work on this ocean. I call this vibrating hydrogen the "5th ray". each bit of hydrogen is a vibrating body, something like a very simple solar system. there's the solid thing outside of it (the "electron"), and then there's the nucleus, which is just built of smaller versions of hydrogen, just like the sun. in fact, it's almost exactly like the sun. anyway these hydrogen bits are all concepts, and if there are enough of them or one of them is emitting strongly enough, it'll produce an image in the eyes or a sound, smell, etc.. what's happening is that the brain/body is just translating that vibration into something that the consciousness can understand. anyway, they've got this hydrogen ocean pretty well controlled, until someone like me takes weed and starts emitting really strongly. I'm not *trying* to make others feel stuff when I'm around them, it just happens. I don't want to be a 5th-ray emitter (or an emitter at all), so they're basically trying to restrict me from affecting their setup. I'm not trying to destroy their setup. it just so happens that the human body is made in such a way that I have a strong effect on that hydrogen ocean, and there's not much they can do about it.
		I want to rebuild my perception in a way that -- this doesn't happen -- but I seem to keep getting pushback on that too. they don't want me to emit, but I can't really help it, cause that's how the human body works, but they don't want me to change my body so that I stop emitting. they're strongly mistaken. I'm at the point now, where I'm just like, OK, I'll be an emitter -- and then I'll find out and prbably build myself the system that I want to make to solve this problem. it's just not a big deal. I don't mind that everyone is using my 2nd-ray system (my lack of pinecone and high speed means that you all are locked in my matrix), and I even kinda want them to be there too, but it's annoying that they have to keep trying to prevent me from doing things like drugs. there's got to be a way where I can do drugs, and their system doesn't get messed up. I don't want to be messing with anyone else's hydrogen; only my own. I don't understand how we both want The same thing. so since we both want the same thing, 2nd-ray perspective (which is what they want me to look through now) says that because there's mutual-back-scratching, and more than one party benefits, then it has to go through (their rules, not mine).
	additionally, there's the fun fact to know that this is a pretty big first in the terms of addiction. prweviously, I would only give it up for the rest of the day or when I ran out -- but this time, I decided to smoke after waking up, wait the full day, and then smoke again at the night. normally, once I start, I don't stop -- so yeah, like pretty cool.
so I got to think a lot about what I wrote during the day, and I'd have to say that there's just no way I can do the 2nd-ray thing. I figure I can't keep waiting for them, so I'm just going to find my own way. time to crash and burn -- but this time more from a 1st ray perspective.
	I've been wanting to make a repo called "pure-desire" -- and I just talk from that perspective. thing is, I don't really know where to start, because everything I write is almoxt all 2nd ray. it's only my concepts which are 1st ray. I'll try to come up with something though, because it's a very interesting challenge. presenting 1st ray ideas is really difficult because they all sound like tragedy in symbol. 
I can either go one of two ways at this point: 1. stop caring about their stupid hydrogen ocean problems and just do what I feel which is to continue being unfocused, or 2. go straight-edge, and then throw it all away, because I'm going way too fast, and I can't avoid girls (when I start getting focused, I'm way more attractive, so I try to stay unfocused because it's the only way I can not get wrecked by girls -- but being unfocused doesn't work well for work, so I never actually get anything done). finally, there's the last way, which is to just throw it all away and start over. I don't really care anymore. these guys don't actually want me to get the idea going, even if it's also beneficial for them, so I don't really mind. I know that the idea will (always) come back evolved and bigger than it was, so for me "throwing it all away" isn't actually all that much. I don't lose anything, and in fact, I actually gain quite a bit. you know, it could even be said that I even gain more by letting it go like that: I didn't get my idea this time, but there's always the next time.

### 2024-03-05 05:07 - what's the difference between 2nd and 5th ray?

I didn't really know for a long time, because they're essentially the same thing. I believe though that the difference is perspective. I'll illustrate with examples: here in the physical, vibrating hydrogen produces pictures (or sounds, or whatever) which astral people can see and interact with. that's just vibrating hydrogen, and we'll think of this as the realm Of the *air*; all of the hydrogen from the surface of the earth up to the net around this planet. when I say "net", I'm referring to a subatomic structure that exists around the earth which catches a lot of the vibrating hydrogen and turns it into something. that's also where the saturnian-system has its "midpoint": from the inside looking out, we see the symbolic reflection that net gives us to see (stars and stuff), but from the outside looking in, there's just an ocean of hydrogen (which is normally invisible), and just like the living-blackness, what begins to take shape, is the mind beginning to recognise patterns in the vibrations and produces symbolic things like images, sounds, sensations, experiences, etc. through my interaction with that ocean of hydrogen, I begin to vibrate differently, and so does the ocean, which then moves me around in *time* (hence why it's called the saturnian-system). from my perspective, I'm interacting with the ocean conceptually, but for someone wayyyy out there, like past jupiter and saturn, the symbolic structures are much m6re ideal
	the reason why more distance (ie more general), is that density of hydrogen increases, not because the hydrogen density increased, but because there's more distance between me and the thing I'm looking at. as an example, hold your thumb up to the sun here on earth, and you'll cover some amount of hydrogen and it'll have say 1 zillion hydrogens per square inch. now, if I were to go out to jupiter, and look at the pixel density of the sun there, it's say 3 zillion hpin2, pluto will be much more than that -- 5-6 zhpin2. that distance allows a person to see more of the concept in a smaller space, so what it looks like, is much less detailed and much more general. therefore, if I look into the saturnian-system from mars, I'll see one thing; from jupiter, I'll see another; and from pluto another still (these are all renderings of my brain about these concepts based on movement patterns and stuff). though I see different things from different vantage points, it's the same earth and the same ocean of hydrogen around it. when I look in at the ocean, from diffrent vantage points, each of those vantage points has a different angle and a different percEived densities to the concept I'm looking at.
so what I'm trying to say is that the difference between 2nd ray and 5th ray is about vantage point: down here on earth, I feel the hydrogen directly. I'm immersed in it, and I'm having direct experience (what I feel isn't something someone told me about), and when I'm out on pluto looking down on earth, *I'm not actually there*, so I'm deducing it from a distance: I'm using symbols and logic to figure out what I'm looking at. evvry tim5 I look at a picture, I have to turn the symbols in the picture (identified in the picture) into a concept (to really *know* what I'm looking at). however a concept is the opposite: every time I translate the concept into symbol (picture, txt, etc), the concept comes out a bit different for me, because I've gained higher density, and so therefore see/feel/interact with the concept from more angles/perspectives and a wider spectrum.

### 2024-03-21 22:08 - another rethink

hi again, I opened up this document to write you again, because today I woke up from a nap where I had a dream about you (or something like that; don't remember now). I was expecting this document to be only a few lines long, but here I am starting another entry on line 49 !!! I don't remember writing that much before, and I don't at all remember anything of what I said. at a glance, it looks like I've had a lot of split energy over this subject, which is what I intend to write about again tonight.
it seems that during the day, I seem more OK with the idea, and even had planned out the text that I was going to write you, but now that the sun is down, that idea feels quite bad to me. I just don't want to write you and be like "hey how's it going -- come fix my problems" -- or even worse is, I say hey and then launch off into a whole bunch of stuff about nosebook and all kinds of my other paranoias. none of that feels good to me at all, and I just don't want to do it. *the reason why I write you here instead of over the phone is so that they can block, modify, and manipulate anything they don't want you to receive.* if I start talking to you directly, then no longer do they have any power -- unless of course, you're working for them, and this whole thing is a sham like my very first paranoia: I find it pretty unlikely that a child was actually created between us, because I went through all of the precautions and stuff, cause I didn't really want kids. I wanted to create something (another website), and it felt to me like kids would make that impossible. obviously that's probably not true, but it's what I thought at the time.
anyway, with all of the manipulation in my life, it seems *far more likely* that you (bea) are just another amazon robot, and then "my daughter" another just the same. cause think about this from their perspective: where I'm at, energy keeps rising steadily -- and even though I'm not star-watching or anything 2nd-ray like that anymore (I'm getting pretty close to only-attraction), the problem will continue to rise -- so they need to isolate me. what better way to isolate me, than to put me on an airplane and send me of to a remote "island" (truman show sound familiar) where I'm there with a 100% robot population.
	the nature of this problem, I belive comes from the fact that I'm starting to "convert" both jaron and greg over to my form of perception little by little. every once in a while they'll have a conflict in their life or with me, and when they talk to me about it, I consistantly am able to identify and point out to them what is the attraction factor that is the *cause* of the problem, and not just look at the actions and hechos (cause that never works). as an example, mom and jaron have been going back and fourth over an issue of money, and I've been able to show to jaron that mom's (perceived) desire to hide what's happening in the finances comes from her own belief that she's not good enough (and low opinion of self) and constantly wants someone else to just magically solve her problems for her (along with her ongoing troubles getting her accounting up to date). I showed jaron how that's not only a "problem" that mom has, but he's also doing the same thing with his therapy and finances. they're both in the same vibe together. then mom will complain how jaron never changes and continually keeps accusing her of the same mismanagement of finances, and jaron complains to me about how there's nothing he can do to get her to be honest and open about his finances -- but again, notice how they're both being really upset and worried about something they don't feel they have any ability to change? it's obvious from my perspective at a distance. I see this subject completely differently becausse I've stated numerous times here in text, and in voice to jaron, mom, and others, that he has no intention or desire to change -- because he's making very little to no effort to change -- and even it would seem that there's actually interest in him *not changing* -- but that's prolly cause of his lack of desire and years of zero improvements, that they've given up on him or something -- but the thing is, even though I know he has no intention of changing, and can see no evidence of desire to do any better at anything he does (even games he plays, or anything), it doesn't bother me. unlike m6m, jaron is not the reason why I feel good or not good. he's just there, and that's just the work I do. I just don't care what his decisions are. same with mom: it used to bother me a lot when mom didn't want to find a way to feel better about something she has no control over, but that too I've completely given up on. I enjoy kicking bacK here and just being an armchair critic. nobody is knows about this anyway :)
so basically what this comes down to is this: during the night and when I'm not on weed, I'm not influenced by the sun, and am pretty well isolated from 2nd-ray/astral perception, which means that *this is how I* **really** *think*. I can't advance on an idea where I've got tons of paranoia on. it just won't turn out well. sure I could reach down into the bottom drawer right next to me, pull out some weed and write something that would be effectively the cOmplete opposite of what I'm writing now, but that's because weed puts m5 into astral/2nd-ray form of perception: push real hard for what I want, and ensure that I get it. **I don't want to do that**. I'm going toward only-attraction now, not 2nd-ray perspective, so all of this feels pretty bad to m5. I must continue to wait it out, and just let them figure out what it is they want me to do, and find a way to communicate that to me.

there's another subject I'd like to approach now too, which is the subject of split-energy and indecision: often times I don't really feel too strongly like I want to go one way vs another, and so what I do is I let a random number generator decide for me (cause I really don't care) -- and so I was doing that today for a bunch of things. two main situations can be clearly identified: first, I kinda wanted to walk on the side of the freeway, cause it makes [for a really nice walk with the cars driving past me](/question-aire.md#2024-03-18-2107---why-do-i-walk-in-the-middle-of-the-road) -- however, there were various motor roars that were indicating that someone was unhappy with my desire to walk on the side of the freeway. fair enough, so I pulled out the random thing, and it tells me *not* to go the way of freeway, but instead to walk along the road. I realise after doing the thing that I'd much prefer to go the freeway, but I've been trying to [practise obedience](/question-aire.md#2024-03-19-1608---why-do-i-recommend-obedience) lately, as it seems that it often times reduces the amount of resistance, and there was clearly a lot of motor roars in opposition to me walking on the freeway, and the "random" generator seemed tto indicate that I should also go the path of lesser resistance (though less enjoyable). I decided I would follow that. then, later on, I came to a street where I could go to straight and have kindof a long-distance view for a bit, or I could go the slightly shorter path (commanche vs villa). the random thing said to go villa, but I felt a pull to go the other way (dunno what it was, cause nothing significant happened), and so I overrided the "random" decision.
in both cases, the random thing showed me what I would prefer to do (freeway and comanche), yet only in one case there did I follow what I wanted. I believe that choice was because I decided to take the less resistant path even though it's less enjoyable (you might be able to see where this is going already). but here's the thing: why don't I just stop making decisions with the random thing? today I was doing it more out of the idea of being obedient by allowing them to give me directions though "random" decisions
	the symbolic portion of the saturnian-system is built on these decisions, which means that whatever I choice I choose to ask the random generator, the saturnian-system will ensure that the "random" result is always going to reflect their direction (even for PRNGs), so doesn't really matter what "random" result I pick, I'll *always* be following the path the system adjusts me tto be on. (I could probably explain this better -- so I'll add a question about it)
really, my goal is actually to find a better way for them to communicate to me their desires (even if it appears "random") -- but even if I know their desire, I often times override it. an example of this would be yesterday mom told me that the time I get jaron dinner is starting to become problematic, and so she wants me to just have dinner on jaron's desk every night by 7pm. I told her I couldn't do that because I only do the things that I want to be doing, and that kind of thing is actually the opposite of that. now, no matter what, I *need* to do something (cause the clock says so), and that's not really what I *want* to be doing. need, in that sense is symbolic, because he doesn't actually *need* food (he's not starving *and* he's fully capable of going to the kitchen himself and getting food) -- and additionally, his desire for me to make dinner is also part of me wanting to make him dinner; so I told her I cannot be obedient to that one. likewise, when it's something that I feel bad about doing, I also refuse, and won't be obedient (my emotional guidance system is better at telling me the path of least resistance). obedience really only is a way in which I can guage the path of least resistance, when I don't have an obvious indication myself (hmmm, I should probably update that answer, cause for a person that doesn't follow their guidance-system, I suppose it could be understood to mean something differently that I intended).
	right now, the main indicator that I have of resistance from nosebook actually comes from motor sounds, however they're not at all consistent with what they disapprove of or show resistance to. the way it works, is that emitters (the top ones in gay sex) are able to emit sound (prolly out of their ears). I've done it myself (though it's disabled at the moment) -- and it's as simple as hearing the sound in my head and projecting it out into the world, as if I can hear it out there, instead of in my head. this ability has existed for a long long time, and there's even strange evidence of it as well (such as beethoven destroying his hearing in an argument -- which obviously was with another emitter, and they were putting out louder and louder sounds as things heated up). anyway, so if those motor sounds are just the sound inside someone's head being put out into the environment, then I would assume that my actions are going to offend more than one of these emitters, and so therefore, I should expect a whole flock of motors making noise, or a parade of birds chirping in reaction to me (from multiple emitters), but that doesn't really happen -- so that seems to indicate to me that there's some kind of system that's controlling how many emitters can emit into my experience, or it's only one or just a few guys. if it's the latter, then it seems like they'd have the ability to be somewhat consistent with what they react to. I just don't really know what it is that they're so upset about the majority of the time -- and often times, I get a motor to some of the most mundane of thougts (like thinking about how to do a chore or something). also, I don't really know how to go the path of least resistance, because let's say for example, I want to take a break and clear my mind. well, sometimes when I lay on the ground, that gets a bunch of motors, and almost every other time when I go outside, that gets motors, birds, visitors, all sorts of stuff. so, I stay indoors most of the time, because I don't want to deal with the noise, and usually I have a few minutes before the sounds start while laying on the ground. I suppose it's possible for me to pull out the random and say "OK, blue for outside" and then decide that way -- "OK, blue for lay on the ground" -- and try again, "OK, blue for taking a shower" (usually not too many shower-motors) -- etc.
my desire to be obedient is to take the path of least resistance. today I sacrificed my own pleasure walking on the side of the road, because it was seemingly a resistant topic for them, and so when it comes to this subject of trying to talk to you, it's the same thing. for me, it's a significant amount of resistance for me to try and assert myself into your life -- and additionally, with all of my paranoias, nothing feels good to me, and so therefore I simply cannot do it. I have to simply wait until I'm feeling good about the whole thing for it to be able to go through. I realise that the 2nd-ray perspective just sees the pleaure and mutual benefit for all (or "highest and greatest good"), but I cannot do that. I have to simply wait for all of my paranoias to get into a good-feeling place before I can make any action.

I did go down to health solutions today and setup an appointment, because one of the major things that I need to have figured out -- and I don't know if dr-sandra will be able to answer all of my questions, is to figure out what all of the effects of castration are on the visual system, because *I want to have flat perspective, and no u-dimension* (I want to become a perfect reflector). so, until I can get someone that can answer those questions,-- again, I don't feel comfortable making any action.
	the process where I selected which doctor I wanted was a bit weird as well. the receptionist listed off the names and asked me which doctor I wanted. I immediately thought about sandra, but she suggested that I look at their pictures on the wall to decide. while I was looking at the pictures, I noticed that I really liked estrella's name -- but I went ahead with my first thought, sandra. later on as I was walking out, in the parking lot, I thought, "I should go back and change to estrella" -- but then a bad-feeling came, and so I decided to ask the random generator. it said say with sandra, so I walked back home. I may walk back tomorrow and ask for estrella, but I've alrady made my decision, so I've got to be accountable to it (cause I don't feel bad about sandra), until I have a really strong indicator that I want to do something else.
we'll see how the interview goes, because I have a lot of questions (I should probably write them down too so they can prepare for them). OK, bye for now! btw, if I do have a daughter (I'll call her k-prime unitl I know her name), and she wants to come to pueblo, send her out! we'll have a lot of fun (causing lots of problems), I'm sure.

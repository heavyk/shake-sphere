I noticed that the centre of hamlet's grief is that he's heartbroken over his mom's *disloyalty*, and this was common for XX women back in the time, because she's just mirroring claudio instead of his father now. hamlet is all bent out of shape because he's tied up in this mutual-back-scratching thing where you can *only* scrath the backs of non-enemies. this, was a common trope amongst the aryan warriers, because they would constantly see these XX women turn to whomever the next invader is.
    these not yet narrated women were all mirrors, and it's kind of like a survival technique, cause the ones that resisted didn't last too long.
    later then, whatt happened is that shakespere, what (I think) he did, is narratively killed off these reflective women in the tragedies, and narrated them to be more like the comedies. shakespere wasn't the first, as this has been happening since the greeks came, and I believe that writing plays about these reflective women, they attracted theirselves and fell "down" out of their prehistoric dream world and into the physical earth. these play-rights have been trying to get rid of the reflective women, cause I don't think they like reflective. I think for them this is all about behavioural modification, and the goal is to essentially narrate these pleasure objects (females and males) in a predictable way.
it's easy to see that the problem created it'self. the poets wrote about the reflective women, the warriors found them, and then in order to keep them, they narrated them, so they would be *loyal* (and submissive) to their husbands. it's absolutuly crazy tto me how many documents, seem to be dedicated to teaching women how to behave. these reflective women were probably a real problem, especially for the bad-guys -- cause then she steals, cheats, and lies, just as much as he does. better are the narrated ones, espetislly if you're the king. I think the best bloodlines have the most well-narrated women, of them all.
    my personal opinion on this is the same thing that I say to everyone else: narration isn't very helpful; what's helpful is atrraction. it's impossible to be able to narrate *everything*, and there are a lot of things that slip through the cracks. as a highly reflective person myself, I've learned that it's all mental, in the way that I see it. if I see someone as evil, then that's what I expect from them, and if I see them as good, then *that* is what I expect. therefore, then it moves into the realm now of image: how do I *appear* to other people, and the symbols transfer from narration into fashion: these symbols *mean* something in the general opinion, and so by appearance, I can *buy* a symbol for myself, and just like that I'm on a narratively different path. I've switched characters in the cloud of narrative expection, just by changing my appearance. theatre and fashion are strongly related, so it's a huge moneymaker. just follow the money, and the origins of the expectations become apparent. choose attraction, and attract your own identtity, by being it -- that's what I recommend :)
wow that got dreary fast... (brb coffee 04:48)

### 2023-10-20 04:17 - the tragic woman

I noticed that the centre of hamlet's grief is that he's heartbroken over his mom's *disloyalty*, and this was common for XX women back in the time, because she's just mirroring claudio instead of his father now. hamlet is all bent out of shape because he's tied up in this mutual-back-scratching thing where you can *only* scrath the backs of non-enemies. this, was a common trope amongst the aryan warriers, because they would constantly see these XX women turn to whomever the next invader is.
    these not yet narrated women were all mirrors, and it's kind of like a survival technique, cause the ones that resisted didn't last too long.
    later then, whatt happened is that shakespere, what (I think) he did, is narratively killed off these reflective women in the tragedies, and narrated them to be more like the comedies. shakespere wasn't the first, as this has been happening since the greeks came, and I believe that writing plays about these reflective women, they attracted theirselves and fell "down" out of their prehistoric dream world and into the physical earth. these play-rights have been trying to get rid of the reflective women, cause I don't think they like reflective. I think for them this is all about behavioural modification, and the goal is to essentially narrate these pleasure objects (females and males) in a predictable way.
it's easy to see that the problem created it'self. the poets wrote about the reflective women, the warriors found them, and then in order to keep them, they narrated them, so they would be *loyal* (and submissive) to their husbands. it's absolutuly crazy tto me how many documents, seem to be dedicated to teaching women how to behave. these reflective women were probably a real problem, especially for the bad-guys -- cause then she steals, cheats, and lies, just as much as he does. better are the narrated ones, espetislly if you're the king. I think the best bloodlines have the most well-narrated women, of them all.
    my personal opinion on this is the same thing that I say to everyone else: narration isn't very helpful; what's helpful is atrraction. it's impossible to be able to narrate *everything*, and there are a lot of things that slip through the cracks. as a highly reflective person myself, I've learned that it's all mental, in the way that I see it. if I see someone as evil, then that's what I expect from them, and if I see them as good, then *that* is what I expect. therefore, then it moves into the realm now of image: how do I *appear* to other people, and the symbols transfer from narration into fashion: these symbols *mean* something in the general opinion, and so by appearance, I can *buy* a symbol for myself, and just like that I'm on a narratively different path. I've switched characters in the cloud of narrative expection, just by changing my appearance. theatre and fashion are strongly related, so it's a huge moneymaker. just follow the money, and the origins of the expectations become apparent. choose attraction, and attract your own identtity, by being it -- that's what I recommend :)
wow that got dreary fast... (brb coffee 04:48)

hamlet is also really pissed off that this guy skipped queue and jumped into the throne before hamlet could. lol, he's so adult.

### 2023-10-20 04:58 - I don't want a new dad

hamlett's like this guy is already treating me like a kid: I shall stay with them and they become my new parents, and I liked my old dad (but he's dead! waaaaaa!)

### 2023-10-20 05:06 - prepped to see his father in his mind's eye

horatio is prepping hamlet to begin to conjure a 3d image in space of his father, to tell him what he desires: motive to get rid of his father.
    this is a common activation of the pineal. it happened to me all the time as a kid where I'd conjure my fears into 3d space. I imagine if I had've been prepped like this to see something I desired or feared, I prolly would have been the same as hamlet. luckily though I lost my pinecone so that didn't become a problem. it took me a long time to get a semi-stable mind where I don't imagine my fear in full 3d manifestation yet. I'm extremely thankful for the loss of my "mind's eye" (where hamlet is going to interact with his father), but the image and the voice, intonation and all of that are going to be of his fears and desires. he desires to get rid of claudio, but he can't figure out any other way than to kill him. he's in the way, and has to go. I'm like that too, and it's gotten me into trouble a few times in alcoholic aggression. in fact, this type of behaviour that hamlet is exhibiting, is one of a drunkard. not only is his mind's eye fooling him into these crazy actions, and not on the idea of trying to just get along with claudio. like what's the big deal dude, just find a way to like him.
by desiring to (no matter what way he tricks himself into it) kill claudio, he kills himself. all judgement outward is reflected on myself. there's no real way to avoid it, and so it's a comedy because emo hamlet is causing all of his own problems, and he's bringing a bunch of others into it. again, I'm kinda like that too. I manage to have this effect of dragging more and more people along with me, whereever I go.
    quick commentary on that: I drag everyone into my problems because I don't have a pinecone. if I had a pinecone, I'm not actually sure what would happen. oh, I'd probably just be a regular joe/jane. that's all. the difference between me/planets and the pineconed ones (insects), is that they only manifest their desires into their mind's eye, but we (plants), manifest our desires into physical reality. we're sort of earth like people (much like the people of africa). the thing is that it takes a bit for it to appear in (physical) reality, whereas in the mind'seye, it's instant. I personally *like* having that kind of delay there, as it gives me time to prepare emotionally for it to arrive. the further away from how I feel to any point in time I desire to get to (the one with the most change), I'm just desire actuating in 3d: max-change.

### 2023-10-20 06:05 - manifestation of imagination

this entire play can only be understood from the perspective of mars: that is, out of his own eyes. for some people they only manifest their imagination into their mind's eye, but for people like me, and apparently tesla as well (and I believe mars as well). the thing is that after realising that the imagination can be interacted with, as if it were a real object (floating/sitting) there in 3d space. tesla (who had a mind'seye) said that he could see his motors in space. well, inanimant objects are the first step, but soon entire creationn, which talk move, and have a seeming physical form, but they're just images. later on, when those objects are believed to be real, they can be pulled into 3d reality.
    I've been known to do this. it's kindof a problem, actually, because these are like real living beings and stuff, so it's really good I don't have a minds'eye, know what I m5an?
this poor guy hamlet is a prince of denmark who were (probably) one of the bloodlines that this spectacular imaging capability: to project their mind out into the world, and have it become living, (sentient) matter; the stuff of the mind.

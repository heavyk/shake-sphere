### 2024-02-07 10:37 - initial sketch

imagine the earth with its north pole (the one with a big hole in it) pointed directly at the sun: the equator of the earth will start to emit tremendous amounts of energy. a ring can then be placed around the equator which will capture a significant amount of this energy and reflect it inwards (the ring is a band with thickness, so inside that thickness is) to where the molten rock is spewing out of this ring (explanation below). from there the lava will get directed down a system of tubes which will be configurable to get the rock moving a defined direction, because the magnetic alitnments will all have the pattern of the travel they made through the tubes. when the lava finally arrives to the end of its travels, it bubbles into these massive infinitely rising platforms of rock, ever widening the disk. the rock coming out of the equators will have the pattern of the tubes in them, which will give this area an interesting "feel" cause of its geology. since the whole disk is laid out with these pen-rose tubes, it is guaranteed that no place of land will feel like another. all land in the most inner will feel the most primitove (mono-tonal), and the farthest out on the ring (all the new development) will have the most complex and intricate feel to it. the farthest out reaches (where the rock has cooled enough, and there's enough atmosphere) is where all of the best stuff is. that's where there would be constant wars and stuff, if there were to be such a thing. the disk grows infinitely outward, expanding itself. the top and bottom plates are not likely to be physically connected (but might likely share some lava (depending on how much cross-interaction is desirable)), because that would include a whole system of routing lava to far away places.
	I have two cool pictures in my head regarding this: one is this giant machine + rock looking thing where from time to time, the tubes shift and lots of rock breaks apart and resolidifies with time. the other one is like this system of using radio frequencies to move materials around, and there are precise tubes which the rocks moves through (but never touches) -- completely sterile installation (I'd prolly do the second one, but the first one looks cool -- like more hollywood-esque imaged).
anway,the grid which the tubes ard laid out upon will be these "pen-rose" grid. imagine these shapes as the removal of two verticies of a pentagram (such that they have (5?) edges -- I can't remember how to make them atm -- but there are three of these styles of tiles, pick two (ie 3 directions) and then there are specific rules to how they get placed out -- and the tiles lay outt infinitely). what the goal of this project is, is to turn really high frequencies into diversity; so, imagine that the higher the frequency, the farther out on this pen-rose grid it goes. the direction that it goes (cause there are 3 grids), determins tthe edge of the equilateral triangle that the energy is passing through. imagine the infinite set of directions on the plane that one can travel going at faster and faster speeds/frequencies. therefore, the farthest out stuff is actually the richest and most intricate of them all: it's a city, where the centre is always the worst part.
	you know frank chester would always talk about this in his demonstration of twe circles where they're in hexagonal shaped position (best circle packing), but then he turns it like 15(degrees) or so, and all of the circles now want to have space around them, because they "go to the peripherie" -- and that one demonstration always stuck with me, because sometimes optimum circle packing isn't always what's wanted. brb

### 2024-02-18 12:39 - charactor actor and reflector

the way I envision the idea is that, intiially the north pole of the earth will be pointed at the sun, and so the northern hemisphere will become the 2-4-6 side (plus 8,9,10,11). the opposite side will become only-attraction. so, over a period of time, all stars and the rest of the universe will go over to the 2nd ray side, because they'll be highly repulsed by the only-attraction side (as an example, just think about how repulsive most of my writings are to so many astral/4d people). they want to live in a *symbolic* universe, where things behave according to a set of defined rules, and not have attraction/perception be the thing that runs everything. I get it, because an only-attraction game wouldn't be very fun, unless the game had infinite diversity (hard/difficult/impossible to achieve in a game), so I envision that for a very long time (millions of years?) we'll have no stars in the sky (not even the one up there now).
eventually, we'll start to have stars on our side, but they won't function the same as the main-sequence-stars do: instead, they're going to be more like centre/foils in that they're only outputting in responce tto what they're receiveing -- and also the direction of the light will go *towards* the star, and not away: I am the light that they want to see from me. in fact, all of us (including the ground that we're standing on) will be illuminated in this way (the same way that mars can see in the dark): I attract the light from the atom/molecule that I want to see -- and no, it's not really going to be a problem that we don't have any stars. our sky will be like the living-blackness, where we'll be able to see whatever we want to see there. many of us will build upwards, and some downwards to get more of the third aspect. we are the charactor.
below us (ie, the northern hemisphere) will be an astral system of magnificent splendour. I don't need to build this system, as it'll happen automatically as a reflection of the rest of the universe. that system will be like a giant brain: a 2nd ray system where all of the stars in the universe will each represent a symbolically/conceptually emissive thing, of which the 2nd ray system will be a reflection of (just like we are here on earth right now). in fact, for most people, they won't even notice a difference: the way the earth functions will be exactly the same: earth will appear spherical, and the rest of the universe will be out there (though some of the stars/galaxies may have changed their positions) and just like the ancients noticed, the constellations in the sky *are* a reflection of the human psyche. for most people, everything on earth will appear exactly how it is right now.
	most have not yet fiured out that the reason why astrology and astrotheology works, is because we (and all inhabitants of earth) are a reflection of the sky (the inner is like the outer and the outer like the inner). so, if someone were to suddenly start to make a big splash and really disrupt things here on earth, the planets, stars, and galaxies will have to reflect the person that is making a big splash -- which is kinda cataclysmic.
the northern hemisphere will then become the symbolic reflector (kinda like enki (+-3-+) or venus (-3)) to the rest of the universe, which is now the actor/ground.

#### 2024-02-18 21:02 - the emitter

I noticed that the system I described is the same as it is now in the earth: anatau as the charactor, aphrodite as the reflector, and the universe as the actor. [as I was writing that, I noticed that it's possible that the "earth" is not actually the earth, but that it could easily be the second earth. the idea here being that the second earth is the "new earth" from 1kya -- the year of our lord -- and the real earth is in some other state that we have no knowledge about]. the interesting thing about this is that the "emitter/charactor" is not actually emissive at all, but is actually reflective and attractive. this turns the whole triad thing upside down. if you were to imagine one triagle, there are two emitters on the bottom, and a reflector at the top (like a pyramid). in the opposite arrangement, there is one emitter at the bottom, and two reflectors at the top. in this arrangement, the characor and reflector are both reflectors, but the emitter is the actor.

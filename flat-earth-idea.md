imagine the earth with its north pole (the one with a big hole in it) pointed directly at the sun: the equator of the earth will start to emit tremendous amounts of energy. a ring can then be placed around the equator which will capture a significant amount of this energy and reflect it inwards (the ring is a band with thickness, so inside that thickness is) to where the molten rock is spewing out of this ring (explanation below). from there the lava will get directed down a system of tubes which will be configurable to get the rock moving a defined direction, because the magnetic alitnments will all have the pattern of the travel they made through the tubes. when the lava finally arrives to the end of its travels, it bubbles into these massive infinitely rising platforms of rock, ever widening the disk. the rock coming out of the equators will have the pattern of the tubes in them, which will give this area an interesting "feel" cause of its geology. since the whole disk is laid out with these pen-rose tubes, it is guaranteed that no place of land will feel like another. all land in the most inner will feel the most primitove (mono-tonal), and the farthest out on the ring (all the new development) will have the most complex and intricate feel to it. the farthest out reaches (where the rock has cooled enough, and there's enough atmosphere) is where all of the best stuff is. that's where there would be constant wars and stuff, if there were to be such a thing. the disk grows infinitely outward, expanding itself. the top and bottom plates are not likely to be physically connected (but might likely share some lava (depending on how much cross-interaction is desirable)), because that would include a whole system of routing lava to far away places.
	I have two cool pictures in my head regarding this: one is this giant machine + rock looking thing where from time to time, the tubes shift and lots of rock breaks apart and resolidifies with time. the other one is like this system of using radio frequencies to move materials around, and there are precise tubes which the rocks moves through (but never touches) -- completely sterile installation (I'd prolly do the second one, but the first one looks cool -- like more hollywood-esque imaged).
anway,the grid which the tubes ard laid out upon will be these "pen-rose" grid. imagine these shapes as the removal of two verticies of a pentagram (such that they have (5?) edges -- I can't remember how to make them atm -- but there are three of these styles of tiles, pick two (ie 3 directions) and then there are specific rules to how they get placed out -- and the tiles lay outt infinitely). what the goal of this project is, is to turn really high frequencies into diversity; so, imagine that the higher the frequency, the farther out on this pen-rose grid it goes. the direction that it goes (cause there are 3 grids), determins tthe edge of the equilateral triangle that the energy is passing through. imagine the infinite set of directions on the plane that one can travel going at faster and faster speeds/frequencies. therefore, the farthest out stuff is actually the richest and most intricate of them all: it's a city, where the centre is always the worst part.
	you know frank chester would always talk about this in his demonstration of twe circles where they're in hexagonal shaped position (best circle packing), but then he turns it like 15(degrees) or so, and all of the circles now want to have space around them, because they "go to the peripherie" -- and that one demonstration always stuck with me, because sometimes optimum circle packing isn't always what's wanted. brb

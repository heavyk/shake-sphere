### 2024-03-17 11:10 - intro

just now when I was waking up, in the dream I was asking someone a bunch of questions that I had for them (which I suppose I cOuld write down as well), and as I got closer to awake, the dream spiraled more and more into chaos, and at the end (still in twilight-zone), I realised I can just answers other people's questions. a question about why the church feels they can do things that others cannot, and I started to answer (what seemed to me fairly obvious), about how power structures work and how the church is just another one of the bailouts for the INFECTED ONES (I'll expand the idea below). that question faded, and another question appeared about how the 2nd-ray intallation worked. I started to answer that one, but upon realising that I should probably just write all of these down, I woke myself up to do just that.
what I decided I'd like to do is, during the day, as imaginary questions pop into my head, I'm going to try and write them down on my phone or something, then later when I get to the cOmputer, I'll write out an answer. the way it works, is that other people's thoughts impress a feeling upon my mind, and that feeling gets transformed into words and ideas using my own symbol -- so for example, you'll notice below that I've transformed the question about the church into (some organisational structure). the reason for it will be obvious in the answer. often times the specific instance referenced in the question, is part of a pattern or larger trend that. I'll do my best to try and keep my answers as little resistancE as possible, and I'll also be as general as I can to try and not dwell too much on any specifics. I may make mistakes, but my accuracy has gotten such that I feel comfortable enough now, that it's fine.

### 2024-03-17 11:24 - why does (some organisational structure) think they can do something that the ordinary people cannot?

originally this question was regarding the holy roman church, but the pattern goes back farther than that. those that want this unequal/assymetrical power structures are none other than the INFECTED ONES. the roman empire (manifested by the greeks through narrative) was one of the first bail-outs for them. the romans were brutal and very heavy-handed (similar to jewish law -- another bail-out), and so it was quite attractive to them. after they invaded and took over the power structures there, the empire starts to destroy itself, because that's the way that structure works: it only lasts for as long as both sides of the equation remain equal. the INFECTEO ONES wish to have one side of the equation *not* be equal to the other side (ie, more power money, wealth, glory, etc) than they're merited, which creates for a sort of imbalance. that imabalance or assymetry of power always leads to things eventually falling apart -- simply because the more they put on their side of the equation, the more they have to subtract from the other side (basic mathematics).
as the roman empire was descending into chaos, they needed another bail-out -- and their desire produced exactly that, jesus (probably in a different timeline than the one we're on now) offered them genetics (a bloodline) which was far superior to the others, which (like myself) he accomplished this genetics by the power of his perception. from there, the HRE was born -- which was really good and provided them with another millena of gas, where they kept their assymetry going for a while, until england and the tudor dynasty finally broke from the church (along with luther and the printing press), and that's when shakespere (and the new world) provided them with another bail-out. from there, the next bail-out I suppose happened with tesla, antartica, the saturnian-system, and the "gifting fields" of area 51 -- where, from there, they (depending on how high up in their power structure they are) are now able to start exploring the solar system and the galaxy. the final bail-out (before myself) was 9/11 (from the problematic internet), which essentially made the entire global perception be completely shaped by the news media, and got the internet locked down pretty well.
locking the internet down isn't enough though, as just words and ideas spoken between people are enough to spark creativity and collaboration amongst others. any advance in radio technology will render their superiority null, and they don't want that -- so they desired something further to bail them out, and along comes myself. previous to myself, the 2nd-ray/astral system was all based on the stars (hence why every mystery religion venerates the sun), and a form of magic or process whereby control/force can be maintained at a distance.
	money, magic, and technology are all symbolic systems which can do work (affect change) at a *distance*; which is what makes the symbolic system work, because it's not experienced directly, but instead interacted with through a barrier, with actions and operations -- and so therefore is much easier to be controlled and to control with it (distance means top-down).
the difference between myself and the sun, is that my 2nd-ray system is essentially a copy of the sun's, however it runs on earth power, and can be directly controlled and manipulated through vibrations in my body. the sun isn't so easily controlled as I am. in fact, the sun is their giant looming problem, because they don't have *any* control over it, and it's causing all kinds of environmental difficulties (from "cosmic rays" to weather difficulties). therefore, because they can individualise and comparmentalise everyone into their own astral reality perception, their problem of collaboration is essentially solved. in addition to that, because I have a physical body, they can use their computers and machines to keep the entire system fully maintained and sustained with the same controls that they've built up since 9/11.
these INFECTED ONES are everywhere, and their entire thing is to have some sort of assymetrical ability where they have more than the rest. they intend to keep the balance of the equation forever in their favour. they exist on earth, which functions under the principle of desire, so whatever they want, they get, and whatever solution they need, it's provided for them ("ask and it is given"). it appears they're never going to change, or go away, and the way that earth works, they'll continually be provided with solutions for their desires/fears. *everyone is*, and not just them. they're not any more special than anyone else; just their sysmbolic system will have you *believe* that they are. so, don't worry about what anyone tells you you can or cannot do. just follow your own feeling of what's right and wrong, and the earth will provide.

### 2024-03-17 16:01 - why do you call them the INFECTED ONES?

a long time ago (I think I was in germany at the time ~2011), I was looking for answers, and like everyone does when they're looking for answers, they usually look outside of theirselves for it. I was no exception, and I started researching aliens and extra terrestrials. most of the information is channeled material and very difficult to believe stories (of things like lizard men having sex with people and other weird stuff). after a while I started to get a sense for what was more plausible and what was not. interestingly enough, also at the time, I was talking a lot with a girl that did statistical analysis, so my mind was a lot on probabilites of things (in this case, the probability of what's believable). one night I got really drunk, and somehow found this website (geohanover.com -- dunno if it still exists nowadays, but a copy of it exists in the nosedocs repo), and in the site there were these fantastic stories about a guy that claimed to have contact with beings from the sirius star system (the sirians). he talked about crazy ideas about how he lives in a normal everyday human body, but then when they would take him out on their ship, they'd shine a coloured laser at him (according to his ray type), and it would transform him into a whole different being, capable of extremely sophisticated thought. I found those stories and a few others highly implausible -- like shine a red laser into my eyes and it unlocks mental capabilites? preposterous, I thought,-- yet it wasn't the stories that captivated me.
in addition to the stories, there were two documents, one was called "sirian guide to spiritual development and the nature of human consciousness" (or something like that). anyway, that document totally blew my mind. it had to have been either written by a genius, or they had to have been actually channeled from some extra-terrestrial source. in the sirian-guide, they incuded a system which they called the 7 rays or something like that, and a whole bunch of weird stuff about energy centres and chakras and stuff. I couldn't care less about the energy centres and chakras, but I instantly recognised that the 7 rays system describes pretty well how I perceive the world. at that time, I didn't see astral, and couldn't remember seeing astral as a kid (that came later in 2015-16), so all of the visualisation exercises were like new-age jargon to me, and I didn't really care for it.
along with the sirian-guide was a weird narrative piece called "an extra-terrestestrial view of creation" -- which were 6(?) channeled messages from a guy named kuthumi. that one I really didn't comprehend at all, because he just assumed that the reader understood the 7 rays in the sirian-guide, and talked about what they were previous in previous times (he claimed some ~1 million years ago, I believe). I really didn't know what to do with that document, and regarded it mostly as fiction.
well, in that document, the way that the channeler translates the messages, they would capitalise certain key words and ideas (I do the same, and have continued on the practise of indicating reoccuring concepts by putting a '-' between the words). one of them was this group labeled the "INFECTED ONES" (in my system it would be "infected-ones"). I thought it so hilarious that the channeler translated the concept in that way (with the capitalisation and everything), that it became a sort of literary joke for me. for a long time, along with the letter 'I' when I'm referring to myself, the only other thing I capitalised was "INFECTED ONES". someone out there would constantly react to it when I wrote it like that, and since I'm one of those button pusher types, I continued to write it that was as a sort of joke. I only really call people names when it gets a reaction out of them, because I can use their reaction energy as fuel to understand the concept.
so, here's the thing: I have a bunch of completely unbelievable stories about space aliens, a truly genius piece of work describing the SEVEN (of course perfect number 7) layers of cOnsiousness, and a random narrative about a bunch of these INFECTED ONES that generates a reaction both when I read it, and when I write it. I'm a sensitive person, so to me, that's evidence enough to know that there's something there, but I didn't know what to do with it, so I shelved the ideas, and let them sorta evolve and grow in my mind. I looked for examples of these layers of perception in my life experience to develop the concept further (cause there's A LOT of details that they completely leave out)
	actually, they don't really leave out all of the details. what I've come to understand over the years, is that these documents are highly symbolic, so what they do is the document only gives let's say a few road signs, and with only those few road signs, they just assume you can see the whole map. they can see the whole map, cause their consciousness fills in all of the missing pieces and implications. for example, in lesson 9, they say "the FIRST and SEVENTH are ALPHA and OMEGA; two sides of the same thing; the serpent swallowing its tail" -- which all sounds really good, but there's a lot to work out between the first, second, and third parts of that sentence. how in the world is the physical plane and the will (I think they called it) plane two sides of the same thing??? the way that they write it, it's basically gobblygook. it's kinda like reading shakespere, honestly, because how these things both be the same thing, and also be the exact opposite ends of each other? it's helpful to visualise this sort of thing as a kind of corkscrew, where you go all the way around to the other side (where the serpent bites its tail), but there's actually quite a bit of space between the two in the u-dimension (inotherwords, the tail isn't actually inside of the mouth of the serpeent, but actually much farther back). it's necessary to look at it with the extra dimension to see that these two polar opposites seem opposite, but are very similarly the same (for example extreme masculinity (metal bands), often looks quite feminine, and extreme femininity (dykes) often appears hyper-masculine). therefore, we can see that one one side (the 7th-ray side), that these vibrations are say infinitely getting slower (like dividing by two to get to zero), and on the 1st-ray side these are infinitely getting faster (multiplying by two to get to infinity).
	another emample (in lesson 3) is where they say 5th-ray (the plane of mentation) is "cOncrete science", and 7th-ray (the physical plane) is "ceremonial order and magic". how in the world can the mental plane be "concrete" and the physical plane of ceremony and magic? doesn't make sense, until figuring out that 7,6,5,4 are all aspects of the 3rd-ray, and so when they're talking about concrete, they mean *real actual vibration* (of hydrogen), and not some magical ceremony where any such sequence of actions, will take on the effect that it's believed to have. for example, I can tell you to walk up and down a flight of 20 stairs with your hand on your nose one direction, and your hand on your bum the opposite direction, and this will give you the ability to understand opposites and how they attract -- which if you do it (and believe the result will happen), you will get what you believe. that's not concrete at all. a rmeasurable and experimentally verifiable vibration *is* concrete: the 3rd-ray symbolic movement (which could be anything, so long as you believe it) is going to be opposite to the concept, and so therefore must be in physical. conversely, if I tell you that something weighs 10kg in the physical, this is a "concrete" measurement, so therefore it's now going to be relative to the vibration of the hydrogen in that medium which defines that weight. the "concrete" measurement is only as accurate as the conceptual medium that it's inside of (ie, out in space, it weighs, something different), and so therefore, it's the mental aspect that makes something concrete, not the physical units which compose it.
		the crazy thing about this document (which must be the channeler's best rendering of their form of perception), is that they just assume that I can work out all of these inbetween details as I'm reading it. filling out those inbetween details took me (13?) years, so I can only imagine that their brains must run at a speed which is completely incomprehensible to us (or at least to me anyway), to be able to infer years worth of information in a single sentence. the words to information ratio is off the charts. to explain, I write A LOT, and in all of those (millions?) of words, I've explained only a small fraction of what the channeler has put into just a few thousand words. if we could talk like that, we'd utter 3-5 word sentences, and each one would would be the equivalent of an entire book of information. the density and interconnectedness of their thoughts is just unbelievable to me. at this point, (and having knowledge of the density of sirius b), I now put a pretty high probability that this document does in fact come from sirius.

the concept of the infected-ones is actually quite an important one. all of us are "infected" to some degree or another, and I can say that even myself, I grew up initially believing the "right way" is an unbalanced equation: I believed that the "good-guys" should get 100% of the turf/wealth/knowledge/pleasure/etc, and the "bad-guys" should get none -- cause that's the way I was taught originally by my environment (go christian america! blast all of the bad guys to smitherines!), and it wasn't until much later that I realised that "YHWH gives rain and provides for the good and bad equally". inotherwords, the idea that we need to live in unbalanced equation was only a mental construction that I had built up in order believe that I should have good conditions (at the expense of someone else); when in reality, the good conditions are like rain, and come out of the air and received immediately as soon as one desires it, and is able to *believe* it'll happen (ex: after the grey clouds come and it smells like rain).
it took me quite a while to realise that anyone can have anything they want, and someone else having something, in no way prevents me from having another thing. it's only when we look at one thing and say, that looks like theirs, but I want it to be *mine* -- or, I don't want them to have something, so I can have more. these are the properties of possession and greed which unbalance the equation. we're all guilty of it, and it's not really necessary.
I'm not quite sure how much of this "infection" I still have myself, but I can assure you, that if you're alive in this galaxy, you have some quantity of this infection still. some have much more than others,-- so it really is very unfair to call them the "INFECTED ONES" when I too have such an infection myself. one day, that desire to have an equation unbalanced in my favour will no longer be present though, but I don't know how far off that time is. until then, I just keep doing my best...

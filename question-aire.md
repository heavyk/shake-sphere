### 2024-03-17 11:10 - intro

just now when I was waking up, in the dream I was asking someone a bunch of questions that I had for them (which I suppose I cOuld write down as well), and as I got closer to awake, the dream spiraled more and more into chaos, and at the end (still in twilight-zone), I realised I can just answers other people's questions. a question about why the church feels they can do things that others cannot, and I started to answer (what seemed to me fairly obvious), about how power structures work and how the church is just another one of the bailouts for the INFECTED ONES (I'll expand the idea below). that question faded, and another question appeared about how the 2nd-ray intallation worked. I started to answer that one, but upon realising that I should probably just write all of these down, I woke myself up to do just that.
what I decided I'd like to do is, during the day, as imaginary questions pop into my head, I'm going to try and write them down on my phone or something, then later when I get to the cOmputer, I'll write out an answer. the way it works, is that other people's thoughts impress a feeling upon my mind, and that feeling gets transformed into words and ideas using my own symbol -- so for example, you'll notice below that I've transformed the question about the church into (some organisational structure). the reason for it will be obvious in the answer. often times the specific instance referenced in the question, is part of a pattern or larger trend that. I'll do my best to try and keep my answers as little resistancE as possible, and I'll also be as general as I can to try and not dwell too much on any specifics. I may make mistakes, but my accuracy has gotten such that I feel comfortable enough now, that it's fine.

### 2024-03-17 11:24 - why does (some organisational structure) think they can do something that the ordinary people cannot?

originally this question was regarding the holy roman church, but the pattern goes back farther than that. those that want this unequal/assymetrical power structures are none other than the INFECTED ONES. the roman empire (manifested by the greeks through narrative) was one of the first bail-outs for them. the romans were brutal and very heavy-handed (similar to jewish law -- another bail-out), and so it was quite attractive to them. after they invaded and took over the power structures there, the empire starts to destroy itself, because that's the way that structure works: it only lasts for as long as both sides of the equation remain equal. the INFECTEO ONES wish to have one side of the equation *not* be equal to the other side (ie, more power money, wealth, glory, etc) than they're merited, which creates for a sort of imbalance. that imabalance or assymetry of power always leads to things eventually falling apart -- simply because the more they put on their side of the equation, the more they have to subtract from the other side (basic mathematics).
as the roman empire was descending into chaos, they needed another bail-out -- and their desire produced exactly that, jesus (probably in a different timeline than the one we're on now) offered them genetics (a bloodline) which was far superior to the others, which (like myself) he accomplished this genetics by the power of his perception. from there, the HRE was born -- which was really good and provided them with another millena of gas, where they kept their assymetry going for a while, until england and the tudor dynasty finally broke from the church (along with luther and the printing press), and that's when shakespere (and the new world) provided them with another bail-out. from there, the next bail-out I suppose happened with tesla, antartica, the saturnian-system, and the "gifting fields" of area 51 -- where, from there, they (depending on how high up in their power structure they are) are now able to start exploring the solar system and the galaxy. the final bail-out (before myself) was 9/11 (from the problematic internet), which essentially made the entire global perception be completely shaped by the news media, and got the internet locked down pretty well.
locking the internet down isn't enough though, as just words and ideas spoken between people are enough to spark creativity and collaboration amongst others. any advance in radio technology will render their superiority null, and they don't want that -- so they desired something further to bail them out, and along comes myself. previous to myself, the 2nd-ray/astral system was all based on the stars (hence why every mystery religion venerates the sun), and a form of magic or process whereby control/force can be maintained at a distance.
	money, magic, and technology are all symbolic systems which can do work (affect change) at a *distance*; which is what makes the symbolic system work, because it's not experienced directly, but instead interacted with through a barrier, with actions and operations -- and so therefore is much easier to be controlled and to control with it (distance means top-down).
the difference between myself and the sun, is that my 2nd-ray system is essentially a copy of the sun's, however it runs on earth power, and can be directly controlled and manipulated through vibrations in my body. the sun isn't so easily controlled as I am. in fact, the sun is their giant looming problem, because they don't have *any* control over it, and it's causing all kinds of environmental difficulties (from "cosmic rays" to weather difficulties). therefore, because they can individualise and comparmentalise everyone into their own astral reality perception, their problem of collaboration is essentially solved. in addition to that, because I have a physical body, they can use their computers and machines to keep the entire system fully maintained and sustained with the same controls that they've built up since 9/11.
these INFECTED ONES are everywhere, and their entire thing is to have some sort of assymetrical ability where they have more than the rest. they intend to keep the balance of the equation forever in their favour. they exist on earth, which functions under the principle of desire, so whatever they want, they get, and whatever solution they need, it's provided for them ("ask and it is given"). it appears they're never going to change, or go away, and the way that earth works, they'll continually be provided with solutions for their desires/fears. *everyone is*, and not just them. they're not any more special than anyone else; just their sysmbolic system will have you *believe* that they are. so, don't worry about what anyone tells you you can or cannot do. just follow your own feeling of what's right and wrong, and the earth will provide.

### 2024-03-17 16:01 - why do you call them the INFECTED ONES?

a long time ago (I think I was in germany at the time ~2011), I was looking for answers, and like everyone does when they're looking for answers, they usually look outside of theirselves for it. I was no exception, and I started researching aliens and extra terrestrials. most of the information is channeled material and very difficult to believe stories (of things like lizard men having sex with people and other weird stuff). after a while I started to get a sense for what was more plausible and what was not. interestingly enough, also at the time, I was talking a lot with a girl that did statistical analysis, so my mind was a lot on probabilites of things (in this case, the probability of what's believable). one night I got really drunk, and somehow found this website (geohanover.com -- dunno if it still exists nowadays, but a copy of it exists in the nosedocs repo), and in the site there were these fantastic stories about a guy that claimed to have contact with beings from the sirius star system (the sirians). he talked about crazy ideas about how he lives in a normal everyday human body, but then when they would take him out on their ship, they'd shine a coloured laser at him (according to his ray type), and it would transform him into a whole different being, capable of extremely sophisticated thought. I found those stories and a few others highly implausible -- like shine a red laser into my eyes and it unlocks mental capabilites? preposterous, I thought,-- yet it wasn't the stories that captivated me.
in addition to the stories, there were two documents, one was called "sirian guide to spiritual development and the nature of human consciousness" (or something like that). anyway, that document totally blew my mind. it had to have been either written by a genius, or they had to have been actually channeled from some extra-terrestrial source. in the sirian-guide, they incuded a system which they called the 7 rays or something like that, and a whole bunch of weird stuff about energy centres and chakras and stuff. I couldn't care less about the energy centres and chakras, but I instantly recognised that the 7 rays system describes pretty well how I perceive the world. at that time, I didn't see astral, and couldn't remember seeing astral as a kid (that came later in 2015-16), so all of the visualisation exercises were like new-age jargon to me, and I didn't really care for it.
along with the sirian-guide was a weird narrative piece called "an extra-terrestestrial view of creation" -- which were 6(?) channeled messages from a guy named kuthumi. that one I really didn't comprehend at all, because he just assumed that the reader understood the 7 rays in the sirian-guide, and talked about what they were previous in previous times (he claimed some ~1 million years ago, I believe). I really didn't know what to do with that document, and regarded it mostly as fiction.
well, in that document, the way that the channeler translates the messages, they would capitalise certain key words and ideas (I do the same, and have continued on the practise of indicating reoccuring concepts by putting a '-' between the words). one of them was this group labeled the "INFECTED ONES" (in my system it would be "infected-ones"). I thought it so hilarious that the channeler translated the concept in that way (with the capitalisation and everything), that it became a sort of literary joke for me. for a long time, along with the letter 'I' when I'm referring to myself, the only other thing I capitalised was "INFECTED ONES". someone out there would constantly react to it when I wrote it like that, and since I'm one of those button pusher types, I continued to write it that was as a sort of joke. I only really call people names when it gets a reaction out of them, because I can use their reaction energy as fuel to understand the concept.
so, here's the thing: I have a bunch of completely unbelievable stories about space aliens, a truly genius piece of work describing the SEVEN (of course perfect number 7) layers of cOnsiousness, and a random narrative about a bunch of these INFECTED ONES that generates a reaction both when I read it, and when I write it. I'm a sensitive person, so to me, that's evidence enough to know that there's something there, but I didn't know what to do with it, so I shelved the ideas, and let them sorta evolve and grow in my mind. I looked for examples of these layers of perception in my life experience to develop the concept further (cause there's A LOT of details that they completely leave out)
	actually, they don't really leave out all of the details. what I've come to understand over the years, is that these documents are highly symbolic, so what they do is the document only gives let's say a few road signs, and with only those few road signs, they just assume you can see the whole map. they can see the whole map, cause their consciousness fills in all of the missing pieces and implications. for example, in lesson 9, they say "the FIRST and SEVENTH are ALPHA and OMEGA; two sides of the same thing; the serpent swallowing its tail" -- which all sounds really good, but there's a lot to work out between the first, second, and third parts of that sentence. how in the world is the physical plane and the will (I think they called it) plane two sides of the same thing??? the way that they write it, it's basically gobblygook. it's kinda like reading shakespere, honestly, because how these things both be the same thing, and also be the exact opposite ends of each other? it's helpful to visualise this sort of thing as a kind of corkscrew, where you go all the way around to the other side (where the serpent bites its tail), but there's actually quite a bit of space between the two in the u-dimension (inotherwords, the tail isn't actually inside of the mouth of the serpeent, but actually much farther back). it's necessary to look at it with the extra dimension to see that these two polar opposites seem opposite, but are very similarly the same (for example extreme masculinity (metal bands), often looks quite feminine, and extreme femininity (dykes) often appears hyper-masculine). therefore, we can see that one one side (the 7th-ray side), that these vibrations are say infinitely getting slower (like dividing by two to get to zero), and on the 1st-ray side these are infinitely getting faster (multiplying by two to get to infinity).
	another emample (in lesson 3) is where they say 5th-ray (the plane of mentation) is "cOncrete science", and 7th-ray (the physical plane) is "ceremonial order and magic". how in the world can the mental plane be "concrete" and the physical plane of ceremony and magic? doesn't make sense, until figuring out that 7,6,5,4 are all aspects of the 3rd-ray, and so when they're talking about concrete, they mean *real actual vibration* (of hydrogen), and not some magical ceremony where any such sequence of actions, will take on the effect that it's believed to have. for example, I can tell you to walk up and down a flight of 20 stairs with your hand on your nose one direction, and your hand on your bum the opposite direction, and this will give you the ability to understand opposites and how they attract -- which if you do it (and believe the result will happen), you will get what you believe. that's not concrete at all. a rmeasurable and experimentally verifiable vibration *is* concrete: the 3rd-ray symbolic movement (which could be anything, so long as you believe it) is going to be opposite to the concept, and so therefore must be in physical. conversely, if I tell you that something weighs 10kg in the physical, this is a "concrete" measurement, so therefore it's now going to be relative to the vibration of the hydrogen in that medium which defines that weight. the "concrete" measurement is only as accurate as the conceptual medium that it's inside of (ie, out in space, it weighs, something different), and so therefore, it's the mental aspect that makes something concrete, not the physical units which compose it.
		the crazy thing about this document (which must be the channeler's best rendering of their form of perception), is that they just assume that I can work out all of these inbetween details as I'm reading it. filling out those inbetween details took me (13?) years, so I can only imagine that their brains must run at a speed which is completely incomprehensible to us (or at least to me anyway), to be able to infer years worth of information in a single sentence. the words to information ratio is off the charts. to explain, I write A LOT, and in all of those (millions?) of words, I've explained only a small fraction of what the channeler has put into just a few thousand words. if we could talk like that, we'd utter 3-5 word sentences, and each one would would be the equivalent of an entire book of information. the density and interconnectedness of their thoughts is just unbelievable to me. at this point, (and having knowledge of the density of sirius b), I now put a pretty high probability that this document does in fact come from sirius.

the concept of the infected-ones is actually quite an important one. all of us are "infected" to some degree or another, and I can say that even myself, I grew up initially believing the "right way" is an unbalanced equation: I believed that the "good-guys" should get 100% of the turf/wealth/knowledge/pleasure/etc, and the "bad-guys" should get none -- cause that's the way I was taught originally by my environment (go christian america! blast all of the bad guys to smitherines!), and it wasn't until much later that I realised that "YHWH gives rain and provides for the good and bad equally". inotherwords, the idea that we need to live in unbalanced equation was only a mental construction that I had built up in order believe that I should have good conditions (at the expense of someone else); when in reality, the good conditions are like rain, and come out of the air and received immediately as soon as one desires it, and is able to *believe* it'll happen (ex: after the grey clouds come and it smells like rain).
it took me quite a while to realise that anyone can have anything they want, and someone else having something, in no way prevents me from having another thing. it's only when we look at one thing and say, that looks like theirs, but I want it to be *mine* -- or, I don't want them to have something, so I can have more. these are the properties of possession and greed which unbalance the equation. we're all guilty of it, and it's not really necessary.
I'm not quite sure how much of this "infection" I still have myself, but I can assure you, that if you're alive in this galaxy, you have some quantity of this infection still. some have much more than others,-- so it really is very unfair to call them the "INFECTED ONES" when I too have such an infection myself. one day, that desire to have an equation unbalanced in my favour will no longer be present though, but I don't know how far off that time is. until then, I just keep doing my best...

### 2024-03-17 18:36 - what do I think about aliens?

they exist, but they don't really make much of a difference in my experience. personally, I don't really care much about to think about the things that could be out there or what else is there, because they're basically all irrelevant to me. for example, I may have inside of my body hundreds or even thousands of diseases, but because none of them are active, they're all irrelevant to me. I used to think that it was an important thing to know what other stuff is out there (you know, to protect myself from it and ensure nothing I fear can get me), but in a system of attraction, I no longer find any of that relevant. these sorts of things are like maybe a wasp nest that's out somewhere where where I'm walking: if I go and poke at the nest (ie emit or assert myself into their experience), I can expect a reaction from the wasps. likewise, if I'm scared of wasps attacking me, I'm now attracting them to come after me, but if I just don't care about them, they carry on with their wasping, and I carry on with my walking. they're basically irrelevant to me, and in the off-chance that wasps carry some sort of symbolic significance to me, they can even be a sort of situational messenger for me providing me with new insight into something. I've often times found some sort of inspiration observing an insect or wild animal, let me tell you: insects are quite alien to my experience. an ant behaves in a way that is completely unlike my own, and it's very difficult for me to even wrap my head around what on earth is compelling the ant to do what it does. likewise, non-AI, and unprogrammed machines (like a chainsaw or an air compressor) are probably the most alien to me. how can I possibly comprehend why they continue to do what they do? I can't possibly imagine just sitting there completely still waiting for somone to come and use me, or throw me away when I'm old and no longer wanted. that kind of experience is so far removed from my own, it's just not possible for me to become one of those. intelligent extra-terrestrial lifeforms are kinda the same way for me.
	for example, the sirians: while symbolically they're mind-blowingly faster and more perceptive than I am, but that kind of perception is loathsome to me. I don't want to look at everything and see, and be able to infer 10 million levels of detail into what it is I'm looking at. that experience is a very sad and traumatic experience if what I'm looking at is something that I don't understand, and so therefore all of the wonder and amazement that life has to offer in the form of novelty and diversity is completely rejected by my own percepton, just because I can't perceive its implications. that kind of lifestyle would be like walking around, and everywhere I look, I'm like "duh, knew that was gonna happen" -- or "yep, I could already see that 100 miles away before I even left the house". really, no thank you to that kind of perception. it's nothing like my own, and I don't want anything to do with it. I'm glad they think they've got everything figured out, but I'm even more glad that I *know* I don't have everything figured out.
	as a random tangent to go off on, I would like to point out that from the ET's perspective, it's exactly the opposite: life is so boring and repititious everywhere else, there is a MASSIVE waiting list to get born into a body on earth. here's where it's all happening, not there! the infatuaton that we have with "the other" is only a reflecttion of the dissatisfaction that we have with our own self. they think we're silly, and from their perspective they can't imagine why we're so interested in all the other stuff. then, of course, they get here, and grow up in an earth culture and come to believe (like everyone else), that everyone else has all the best stuff. when they're out there, they have the advantage of quite a distance in perception, so they can see the value of what we have and believe that once they get here, of course they're going to just love it; however, obviously when they get here, they grow up as we do, to believe that everyone else is superior to self, and lose that distance of perception. O how wonderful it would be to get here and to value self as much as they do with that kind of distance of perception. they all dream of being one of the ones that figure out how to do that (in spite of the terrible odds against it). if they could get to their perspective out there, while here, it's the equivalent of winning the mega zillions jackpot.
the only thing that has any effect on my own consciousness, is what I perceive in my own world. everything else is just (not sure the word; something like a tool or an accessory). to explain the concept, let us consider that every hydrogen is conscious. it vibrates a certain way, and so therefore interacts with its environment in sympathy with its vibration. therefore, because it interacts, it has a mind (a very simple one, but a mind nonetheless). we'll consider the spectrum of that hydrogon's interaction to be a pretty narrow one, but it it around another similarly vibrating hydrogen but slightly different, and those hydrogens are attracted to be together, so they stay near to each other, and because both of them have slightly different spectrums, the spectrum of the couple is slightly more than before. get 3, 4, or 5 together and it expands further, all the way out to having enough similarly vibrating hydrogens in a sort of chain, and a blackness/whiteness occurs, because the spectrum is now so wide. that's the consciousness part, so now let's compare that to the unconscious or accessory/tool part which is most of the other elements. those elements emit, not in a continuous spectrum, but in a defined spectrum, and so therefore are specific in their usefulness. however, look inside of the nucleus of one of these "unconscious" atoms, and yet again, there are masses of these elemental types that can come together and form a continuous (or defined) spectrum (mini hydrogens? I don't know the name of them). therefore, consciousness, is really only conceerned with what it can interact with, and consciousness adjusts its spectrum to interact with different things. if it's not something on my spectrum, there's no reason to worry about it, because it doesn't interact with me.
anyway, since consciousness is everywhere, what really matters is not so much what's there, because lots and lots and lots of stuff is there; instead, it's more about figuring out what it is that *I* want to perceive and interact with. I may sound kinda snobbish, but for me, I don't really have much desire to go backwards into the realm of defined perception (which ET lifeforms and even stars have (they're not fully black)), but instead I'm interested in the expansive continuous spectrum that's only present when *all* can be perceived, and then I decide what I'm most interested it. I want the most options, and the least pre-defined definitons, which is the widest spectrum, which allows *me* (my consciousness) to choose what I see. [I'm really struggling to convey this concept, because it's sort of a paradox. maybe like this:] I don't want to see from an alien perspective, because it's limiting; instead, I want to see from all perspectives, and make sense of it for myself.

### 2024-03-18 10:44 - why aren't all stars black?

to our eyes, stars would look black, but they actually have a very very very dark bluish hue to them. the reason why this is the case is because of the way LOA and reception/emissinn works: a material (like an antenna) is going to be good at receiving/absorbing certain wavelengths, and of those wavelengths, that same material is also going to be just as good at emitting on those same wavelengths. it's a mutual relationship between what you can receive and what you can emit. this property can even be observed in a child as they're growing up: as they gain capablity of receiving the sounds of words, and understanding them, their same capacity to speak those words increases. most noticeable of this effect is in regard to the feeling of emotion. if a person is able to feel a sort of sadness, then that same person is also able to emit the same sadness. a physical example of this (besides an antenna) would be the element of carbon: it's black, which means that it can absorb all wavelengths, and if you were to look at it's "spectral lines", there wouldn't be noticeable bands that it reflects on like most all other elements, but instead has a "continuous spectrum", and can receive and emit on all wavelengths.
	I've tried to figure this out looking at the "spectral lines" on wikipedia for different materials, and I only get more confused. for example, for carbon, they show it having very specific spectral lines, when that simply cannot be because it's visibly black, which means that at least in the visual spectrum, it should be responding on all of of the visible frequency (at least absorbing them). the other one is silver: they also have very distinct spectral lines for silver, but as a reflector, silver must be able to absorb (and then retransmit) all the frequencies it is reflecting -- so it too should (if it's any quality of mirror) should be optically black (and any derivative from a continuous spectrum across all colours could only arrive from tarnish). finally, there's uranium: my intuition says that it should also be pretty black, but again, wikipedia shows a very definite spectrum. I don't know how they calculate these spectral lines, but just by looking at the spectral lines for hydrogen, I can immediately tell you that they're calculating the spectral lines incorrectly, *because the giant ball of fire up in the sky has a continuous spectrum*. I do agree that hydrogen usually has a very simple spectrum: each one with its own unique frequency -- so each hydrogen should have really only one line, and it's only when large quantities of hydrogen each with slightly different frequency are clumped together (like a star), would a continuous spectrum appear. carbon is also very versatile like hydrogen, and I would hazard a guess that if we could get a single carbon atom (hydrogen and probably uranium too), it would have a single definite spectrum, though their spectrum is programmable: for hydrogen, its vibration moves slowly over time to become similar to the vibration of those around it, and in fact, if we could look at a star in an individual per-hydrogen basis, we would see all of these hydrogens colours oscillating through the entire emission spectrum of the star, probably many many times per specond (I can't tell how fast, but it's pretty quick). the oscillations also have a distinct pattern to them, where if we could take an instant snapshop of the star, the colour spectrum distributed over its surface would have these really cool geometric shapes and undulations.
so because stars are pretty close to black emitting almost perfect white light, it's "good enough" -- and that's more than enough for them to work with LOA in a way where they can continuously keep growing. this process of growth happens to all of us all of the time, and is the way that LOA and the basic property that "for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction" -- which means that for every interaction that any vibration has with another thing (for example with destructive interference), a second vibration of opposite (dunno the word) is produced. I'll try and explain: if I push on something, that same thing has to push back an equal amount, or be moved itself. that resistance has to do something with the force, and so usually it's dissipated in another wavelength like heat or light, which is not the exact opposite of the incoming vibration, but of a higher frequency, whos harmonics are equivalent to the "destroyed" wave. inotherwords, (except in contrived cases), it's never possible for the receiving object to produce an exactly opposite waveform, and so therefore a higher frequency waveform must be produced to resist the emission of the first. those higher frequency opposite emissions, *usually* are never received back again, and being a vibrationally dissimilar frequency to almost everything else, they keep getting pushed more and more outward (repulsion is the same as attraction) on their way back to source (or, it's possible to say that such high frequencies are only attractive to source, and so therefore get attracted to go way out there). stars have a giant sphere around them though which is good at capturing a very good portion of these very high frequencies, and so therefore the star's aura can recover a lot (most) of the unwanted emission traveling outward, and recover that hydrogen (which is why they keep growing).
	it is usually the case that the hydrogen that is created as a result of a conflicting is never recovered, but the very fact that a star can very rapidly capture that hydrogen and make it useful again. an example of this, would be say I had something of mine destroyed; that cOnflict will have produced a lot of hydrogen in the process (nothing is ever destroyed, but only changes its frequency to be something where we can no longer see or interact with it). [I like to think of the story of job when it comes to this subject: if I push on something, that effort produces 1x quantity of that effort at a higher frequency, but if I destroy something, it produces 2x quantity of that effort at a higher frequency: the destroyed thing itself goes to a higher frequency, and also the high frequency opposite of the effort [technically it's *up to* 2x cause all the stuff that remains visible, like the ashes, body, or pieces of the thing destroyed didn't make a transition into a higher frequency]] therefore, when when I'm looking at the destroyed thing, that destruction has resulted in a higher frequency version of itself, and my attraction which brought the thing in the first place, will attract another thing of similar (usually better) type. 
in our own lives, just think about how rapidly we would grow (like a star) if we were able to recover more than 100% of all the interactions in our aura: the quantity of hydrogen would accumulate endlessly until the attraction all that hydrogen makes attraction so rapid that we too destroy ourselves -- well, a star is not only able to capture more than 100% (over unity) of all of the hydrogen interactions in its system, but it's also able to transform those high frequency vibrations into lower frequency (usable/visible/tangible) ones again (like producing elements, and adding more layers it itself, which produce light). stars are quite resourceful in their ability to convert rejected/dissonant hydrogen back into something useful again. they're "over unity" machines, which is why they're *eternal*.
now, stars don't actually need to capture *all* of the unwanted vibrations that are in their system, which is why they're not black. in fact, stars (like humans) often times choose to only recollect certain vibrations, and let the others continue on out to source. a common trope of these is "sacrifice for the greater good" -- because it is true that a sacrifice (meaning destruction of one thing, and everyone's reaction to the destruction) will create tremendous amounts of hydrogen, of which they can recover a large portion of, that sacrifice isn't actually attracting what they want: it's just pickeing up the pieces/ashes and transforming/rebuilding it into something new again. sure, it creates more, but attraction says that those sorts of destructons will continue to happen, because it's what's *expected* to happen (our own beliefs keep repeating in our experience), so the continual cycle of destructon and rebirth (phoenix effect), does continue to create more, and so as long as the net result is over 100% return, it's not necessary for them to actually be receptive to all frequencies.

### 2024-03-18 21:07 - why do I walk in the middle of the road?

one of the things that people have often noticed that I do, is that I tend to gravitate to walking in the middle or on one of the sides of the road. I don't do it consciously at all -- and it wasn't until only recently that I figured it out for myself (cause I've often wondered this question about myself too)
	I do a lot of really strange things, and I don't really know *why* I do them -- just, it's just what seems natural to me, until someone comes along and tells me the way I'm supposed to do things. I can't really explain what it is, just it feels weird -- like a sort of (lighter than) discomfort for me to do it the other (usually) "right" way. I'm very untuitive, and that same feeling is the one that tells me where the bug is in my code, or that there's something more to what I'm looking at.
it turns out that in the middle of the road, there is energy that swirls, and I tend to gravitate toward that energy. when I'm out in the wilderness or some place that's got a lot of nature, the sensation that I want to move some place is even stronger, and it's the way that I found the blackberry bramblebush "fort" that I made in torrelodones, and it's also what's caused me to want to sit under trees or be near certain rocks.
the way that I understand the energy now is basically like this: the solar wind that's coming off of the sun is mostly hydrogen, and when it hits earth, it's constantly filling a sort of hydrogen ocean that is present on the surface of the planet. it's the atmosphere, and I believe people of old used to call it the ether. it's ocean of hydrogen that surrounds the earth and is shaped and constrained by megalithic structures and water vapour. it's also what causes the rain. anyway, that ocean is rotating with the planet in roughly the same direction as the wind, and the wind is the biproduct of increases and decreases in density of these hydrogens floating around. some large structures, notably skyscapers, forests, oceans, and most notably of all the great pyramid have a large impact on the vibration of this hydrogen. in terms of the saturnian-system, this hydrogen layer is the 5th-ray (inside-out) aspect which we look through to see the stars and sun and stuff like that. it's basically a movie screen, very much like the inside of the brain is. above a certain layer (prolly 20-30km up), this hydrogen ocean begins to take on form, just like the way that our imagination starts to turn the swirling hydrogen in the brain into pictures and stuff. from at a distance, looking in toward the planet, there's so much of this hydrogen swirling around and vibrating similarly to certain concepts, the brain starts to interpret the moving/living-blackness into things that are recognisable to us.
	these two lenses, the ocean of hydrogen which we're looking through to see out into speace, allows us to see stars,  have electricity, and gives us a constant speed of light; that's the inside-out perspective, and there's a similar inside-out lens inside of the eyes/brain which we're looking out at the world through. the outside-in in lens for the planet is the same thing as all of the hydrogen that hovers around the body as well (the "aura") -- and the outside-in lens for humans, just like the earth also has counter-rotating layers which give different degrees of perspective.
		as an example of this, have you ever looked off into the distance at something, and seen it as a sort of flat picture, where all the things are just there, but don't really have importance or identity, but then one day, let's say you finally drove out to see that place you'd been looking at from a distance, only to notice all sorts of things that you never really saw before,-- and then upon returning back to your place where you look at it from a distance, the image changes a bit, and those things can be perceived? well, the reason is, because at a distance, those things are in a more outer layer of your aura (which is usually lower density, which is lower resolution). now, say that somehow all of a sudden something happens like a more energetic solar flare or something like that happens, and then all of a sudden, the distant place seems clearer and those objects that were only really nociceable upon approach, can now be seen at a distance? well, that too happens because of both the enhancement of the human aura, but also from increased density (or coherence) in the ocean/aura around the earth.
	like the layers of atmosphere, each of those layers are conter-rotating, and also has different densities -- which has the effect of allowing the brain to filter out things at a distance really easily. the brain can (unless purposefully analysing it), effectively ignore all concepts/vibrations/things which are at a distance. the secondary effect is that the way that the brain draws boundaries/borders and edges around things is different as well: things off in the distance do not need to have depth to them, and so the brain looks at them entirely differently (more like looking at a picture, than through the eyes).
we are constantly moving around this invisible ocean of hydrogen/concepts with our cars and with our bodies (anyone watching someone dance for a prolonged period of time will notice this effect quite dramatically). if you'd like to try it out for yourself, try walking along the curb on the side the cars drive same direction as you, then try the opposite side walking against the traffic, and then try walking in the centre divider. on the right side of the road where cars drive on the right (and the barrier is on the right), the energy has a distinct feel to it: for me it swirls anti-clockwise,-- and in for left side drivers, it probably would be clockwise (though I've never been to a country with left drive so I couldn't say). the energy also pushes me forward, (and it's not just the wind), which puts me in a sort of trance state. walking on the side of the freeway is actually quite enjoyable to me because of this. when walking on the centre divider, I feel like I'm constantly being turned in my brain, kinda like when doing mushrooms, when they're coming up my consciousness makes a twist as well (which is to the left/anti-clockwise), which again, I would imagine that in a left-side driving country, the mushroom expereience would be opposite. I want to try it some time and find out.
	also while I'm thinking about it, 50/60Hz electricity also has a different effect on my brain and my mentality as well: 50 makes me relaxed and at ease, whereas 60 keeps me on edge and more alert. the frequency of electricity seems to set the "clock rate" of the culture -- and for example, in my room, I've begun to plug more and more things into the outlets, to have more and more parts of my room vibrating (if nothing's plugged in, no vibration is happening: it's an open circuit).
the final thing that I've noticed a lot of too is that this "chi" energy coming off of the sun, as it hits flat objects, it makes a splash, much like spraying the hose at a wall -- but it's also modified by the "prana" energy that's coming up out of the ground, and usually is most potent at peaks and pointy things sticking out of the ground (like fence posts and stuff). this effect can be seen visually as clouds pass over the top of mountain peaks, btw, as the two energies combine. I tend to like a mixture of both, but lately I've come to enjoy the earth/prana energies more than the solar/chi energies, as it's pureer in form (more on that in the future when I talk about antarctica and the 2nd-ray installation)

### if I'm so good at "seeing" things, why don't I just (...)?
### can you explain this antarctica thing?
### can you explain the 2nd-ray installation?
### why obediance?
### can you explain "know thyself?"

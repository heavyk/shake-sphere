### 2024-01-04 00:24 - a time of study (the premise)

hi sarah, I find myself in the next period of my life: one of study. the other day (yesterday, actually) I was watching a production of "all's well that ends well". it was an all-female cast and it was at night, which was pretty cool. anyway, I really liked it because they went slow with the delivery of the lines (easier for me to understand) -- but also I noticed an interesting effect, which was that I was receiving the concept of the words being spoken by some of the actors. it's pretty normal for me to capture the concept that a woman speaks -- much moreso than with men even. so I really liked the production and it made me think of you, because some of the way the actors delivered the lines reminded me of your directions of where to look at, and how to be in the scene. one of the things I noticed too is that it felt as if I was scrutenising them, but I assure you I was not, and there was a sense that they felt as if they were not quite as good as other productions; but that wasn't what I was looking at or anything like that. so then add that idea to the realisation that I'm basically going to be "stuck" with a whole lot of women (basically because the dudes are sick of me seeing through their charade), there was a sense that I'll have to get used to being around a bunch of noobs. that's totally fine with me, and I'm actually writing this with the main intention of saying that I don't really care how anyone is, because none of that matters. the only thing I look for really is improvements, essentially only in myself, so it doesn't really matter to me what anyone else is doing, where they are, or what skill level they're at. I'm constantly analysing (mostly myself and my own body/emotion) and noticing things around me which I can find an improvement on; and if I'm ever complaining about something, it's because I have a better way of doing it, but for whatever reason I'm stuck doing it the worse way (usually this happens with software and user interfaces). I don't really consider myself an actor, and I'm never really dressed up (not even for halloween), or played any part other than myself, because though I can see things from another's perspective pretty easily, I cannot behave like they do. if they treat me one way, I can treat them the same way back, but even if I'm copying someone else's behaviour (because I like it and want to copy it), I'm still making their own behaviour my own and integrating it into my personality. I'm to a point in my life now where I can really only be myself. so I don't really try to be anyone else.
so, just a little bit of background on my situation: I'm not really able to be assertive anymore (or even an actor). to understand what I mean, I'll use examples: I cannot be bertram anymore because I have no intention of fighting wars or making anyone else conform to my perspective. neither can I be helena, because she's reflecting bertram -- and I have no such assurtive person to reflect. I'm reflecting you right now, which is why I'm explaining so much, and I haven't even started what I want to say :) (sorry). so, the difficulty I have is that it's pretty much impossible for me to be assertive, unless I'm reflecting an assertive person. if someone were to get up in my face and try to make me do something, then I'd have the capability to get in their face and tell them what to do,-- not because I want to, but because I'm just showing them their own desire (for me) reflected back to them. all of that means that I'm basically like a balloon floating around wherever the wind pushes me; and if someone hits me, I can reflect an equal amount of force back to them and propel in the opposite direction they pushed me, but I don't have any propusion system of my own: in shakespere terms, I'm silvius/silvia, and I'll get passed off to whomever valentine pushes me towards (or pop, cause I don't want to go). I can explain the reflective of this in much greater detail later.
so, because I'm entering the next stage of my life where I'm going to begin my studies -- or, in love's labour's lost terminology: give up my books and dedicate myself to some amount of time of improvement. I know what I want to study already: genetics, electricity, frequency, and vibration; stuff like that. I'm pretty good at it already and I know already quite a bit. all of those things are based around attraction. so, for example, if I place two metronomes on a surface that is able to vibrate, the easier that surface can vibrate, the faster the metronomes will synchronise. that surface can be thought of like a medium such as air, water, print, news, social networks, or television (it's all the same). so, the less resistance a meduim has, the more rapidly the two metronomes will synchronise. so how does the synchronisation of two frequencies attract each other? well, in physical there's a lot of resistance between everything (at least air separates everything), however in space, there is virtually zero resistance, so if you were floating out there, and you wanted to go to a planet, just start vibrating similar to the planet, and you'll go towards the planet, until of course your vibration is dissimilar enough to the planet, and you'll start to orbit the planet (the distance of the orbit is the amount of difference between your vibration and the planet's). fortunately, we don't have that problem on earth, or else everyone would be runnning into each other just by listening to the same music or watching the same TV show. though we don't run into each other *physically*, we do run into each other *conceptually* all the time -- and so two people listening to the same radio station or listening to the same concert are joined *conceptually*.
	concept is very much more different than symbol, as concept is just a feeling (like feeling like you know something or someone -- or the feeling that the music gives reminds you of something). all *memory* is based around concept, and if I may quote holofernes:
	"This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of *memory*, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it."
	she's talking about the translation of concept/feeling into visuals, in just the same way that memory works. we traslate a feeling of how the past was into pictures sounds, figures forms, shapess, etc. it's a capacity we all have, but for those in whom it's *acute*, it's a gift. the acuteness just means that there's a clean signal, and not a lot of noise (like how memory gets fuzzy with time); because we're tuning into the past, the song, the figure, the form, or the idea from our present moment and state of being, which means that emotion and mood determines reception.
	now, consider how much easier it is to remember something the past when listening to the same song as was playing then, or the same movie as then, etc. -- we can not consider that media to be the medium which allows your brain to synchronise with the past/object/form/idea/etc. by synchronising the concept in your brain (ie getting the hydrogen inside your skull vibrating similarly to the vibration of that moment in the past), you are literally tuning into something that is not even in the same time or space that you are -- and you can only receive the idea/memory/object for as clear as your head is. shakespere bypasses all of that though and just sticks to symbolic harmonisation. his works have multiple levels to them: there is the dictionary that is used commonly (and the definitions of those words), but there are also other symbolic layers in which one can synchronise (for example all of the toilet humour or the political references). what shakespere has done in his plays, is to take a bunch of people through a symbolic landcape of action and definition. these actions happen, and that defines proper/improper (or some other definiton of) behaviour. the actions tell a story and paint a picture, to which the audience has an emotional responce, based on their preception of those actions. those that react the same way to the same actons feel the same way, and those that see the toilet humour get a good laugh. the symbolic sequence of interactions (the play) is the medium whereby society (or at least those that consume those works) synchronise.
		personally, I'm kinda new to shakespere, and having zero exposure to him prior to a few years ago, I am surprised to find that the skakespere medium is still in very wide use in nearly all story-telling formats (movies, theatre, music, etc) -- and most of the rest is just a derivative of it. I had no idea how ubiquituous it was... dang...
so, here's tthe thing: I have certain things that I want to accomplish regarding genetics and stuff like that. I can enumerate them, but this is quite long already; so, just know that I want to actually put a lot of these ideas into practise.
the way I want to go from where I am now, to having all of this new genetics technology is simply not possible with today's physics and scientific theory. it just won't work. I also want to leave all of that behind, and I'd like to jump into this idea of going with an all-female cast. I'm pretty done with the guys and all of their recognition and doing things the right way, so what I want to do is to get a bunch of girls/women together, and the goal is to simply learn how the world works from a frequenntial perspective. the way I described two metronomes synchronising, is the way that electricity works too, btw -- so there's no need for all of the complicated stuff that's found in today's physics books. I figure the general concept of everything from space, stars, planets, electricity, and genetics can all be explained in less than 20 pages (with a suplementary tome of examples). I also plan on using normal everyday items that can be aquired for very cheap to do it, as well -- such as sound cards, and simple simple computer programs. I do not plan on needing any large-scale hardware or anything like that, cause it's not necessary. in combination with all of that, I can show that the way that vibration works, *is* the way that emotion works, and it's also the "secret" to happiness and well-being (as soon as you realise what you're attracting). I will be able to make all of this complicated-sounding stuff simple and easily approachable. it's really not that hard, cause the key to it all is emotion and recognition of how one feels. sure it's possible to divorve the science stuff from the emotion stuff (which is what modern academia has done), but I find that *all* of our understanding is a reflection of our perception; and, to understand perception is to understand emotion, because it determines the clarity and tint of the idea/figure/memory/motion that the brain is conjuring.
OK, that's the premise. (brb)

### 2024-01-04 11:25 - 

hi again. well I've slept on the idea now and I have a few more thoughts and stuff. I'll start with my concerns: the reason why I want to do the genetics stuff is because women have a tremendous effect on me, and I must say that whenever I'm around women for any length of time or get close to them in any way, I take on their form and style of thinking. I don't want to say that they're like a contageous disase, but it's kind of like the contraction of a virus: all of a sudden I start to think like they do, worry about the things that they're worried about, like the same foods,-- actually all manner of my personality changes, and I kinda lose m/ identity, and gain theirs. with different women it happens a bit differently, and the diffreences are usually reflective of their personality types. I've been like this all of my life, which is why I've traditionally been quite a loner. like holoferfernes, I too have a very acute memory is a "foolish, extravagant gift" and the the precision has come mostly from being alone. around all types of people (men and women alike), I tend to adopt (or reject) their sense of responsibility. that responsibility and structure is what stifels the skill -- because then no longer am I able to be "foolish and extravagant" (because if I'm foolish and extravagant, then I can receive foolish and extravagant ideas). I believe shakespere inundated himself with toilet humour, in order to separate himself mentally and physically from the ultra responsible people (like say william cecil), and that allowed him to be foolish and extravagant. he partitioned himself, such that the political stuff that he was involved with (obviously the tudor stuff) could be on one symbolic level, and another partition of himself was just having fun making penis jokes. I'm kinda the same way as he is, but I don't work symbolically like he does. I'm primarily a cOnceptual person, and not symbolic. I can partition diffrent emotions quite well, so for example if I'm taking care of someone, the way that I feel when I'm doing that is completely different from the way that I feel when I'm coding or being creative. some of the way I feel bleeds over between the two, so (like hamlet) I can be ruminating on extremely insightful things even inside of a big mess. however, I don't really have that super duper well under control just yet, and I can't *always* feel the way I want to feel in whatever situation -- though I'm pretty dang good at it, by now.
so here's the concern: I know that if we were to do the project that I want to do, and I'm around a bunch of women, then I'll "lose" the concept that I have about how attraction, light, energy, and magnetism works *from my perspective*, because now I'll see everything from their combined perspective. my previous way of conceptualising things will [you know, it occurs to me that I'll probably want to put this part at the end when I rewrite this] be completely scrambled and in disarray, because of how strongly other females cause me to feel differently. historically, I usually leave them and go back to being on my own because I like the clarity of my own concepts, and not the confusion introduced by responsibility, and "the right way", politics, and socially inforced behavioural expectations. by myself I can just have fun and do my own thing. due to past conflicts with others (most notably other women) I definitely *don't* try to make anyone else conform to the way I would want something done, or try to affect action or behaviour -- and this is the main difference of who I AM, in comparison to shakespere (or bertram): I don't emit anymore, but only reflect now.
obviously it's completely impractical for me to remain alone and in my thoughts forever running away from others that feel differently from how I do, so I've come to just accept that I'll get all of that scrambled in one way or another. in fact, the very situation that I'm in, is exemplry of exactly that: the concept that I had when I was writing last night is completely different from the concept that I have now, because whatever happens during the night when I'm asleep has a similar scrambling effect, and I wake up usually feeling way worse about the idea than I do when I go to sleep (for me, I tend to have my most enlightened thoughts and ideas near the end of the day, and the morning is when I have all of those fear and responsibility relating thoughts -- because that's what the people inside my head while I'm asleep feel like, so I tend to wake up feeling more like they do). I'm way better now at feeling the way I want to feel after waking up, and you can see that writing now (2h after waking up), I'm considerably more positive and focused on the wanted aspect (or at least you'll notice in the next part anyway), so I'm really making a lot of improvements when it comes to that. I'm obviously not perfect at it, and so I enjoy the practise that my present situation is giving me in deciding to feel the way I want to feel, and don't really want to leave just quite yet (which is why I'm writing this as a rough draft where I get my thoughs out, and not something that I'll actually send).
therefore, I've just come to accept that my concept of attraction (light, frequency, magnetism) *will* get scrambled when I start on this project. it'll be basically completely gone, as I'll be only capable of seeing things the way that the women I'm around see things -- but just like how I've come to be able to recover from sleeping at night, I know I'll get the concepts back -- AND they'll actually come back better than I had them originally (concepts are more vibrant the more angles they can be seen from). I call this "evolution-of-desire", (desire is attraction) and all concepts exist because of desire (desire is all the stuff that didn't work, attracting other things that didn't work, coming together to make or add on to another concept). so, for example even if all of that gets scrambled, I cannot go back to being dull to the world around me. I *like* having that kind of acuteness that holofernes has, and I *like* to be foolish and extravagant, which means that the concept *will* return back to me with more aspects than it had before it was destroyed.
	in space, imagine it this way: I am the sun, and another concept is like a giant meteor or comet the come in right towards me. whether it impacts the sun, or gets really close to it, it will cause a CME on the sun (an explosion), and all of the matter that is ejected from the sun, is the destruction of the sun's previous version of the concept, by manifesting it into physical form. if the explosion of the sun is big enough (like say a cataclysmic explosion or "nova"), then the entire outer layer of the sun (it's concept of reality) will be completely ejected out into the solar system. all of that matter goes out, some of it is attracted by planets, and some of its similarly vibrating matter will atrract together and create new meteors/comets, which will then begin to be attracted back to the sun to repeat the process again.
	the process that I'm performing is exactly like that right now. every time that I take a cnncept (hydrogen in my head) and turn it into something physical (text, words, and ideas), then I'm essentially doing the same as the CME. normally the planets that are in fromt of me (like a person I'm standing in front of talking to), receive the brunt of the explosion, but in this case I'm writing text and not really sending it directly to anyone, which is kinda like a CME going off out into space, and the planets (other people) that resonate with some part of the materialisation of that concept (this text) will read it or get affected by it in some way (just like two peole listening to the same radio station feel a sort of "togetherness" even thought they may be miles apart). all of that plasma eventually forms to create new comets which will be attracted back at me (the sun) so that the process can continue (though I'm much more like the earth, I'm using the sun as an example here because it's easier to see with SDO images and stuff these explosions, but the earth does the same thing with much higher frequency CMEs -- and they too go out and eventually come back to earth in a new form).
so what I think will end up happening is that I'll just get absorbed into a new conecptual framework which is a reflection of the women around me, and we'll just take it from there. I'm not concerned with my concepts being scrambled or destroyed because they'll return back in a new form. so, what I propose is that we just jump in and take it from there. it won't be perfect, and can never be anyway (because we all start where we are, which is going to always be imperfect or lacking in some way) and it'll always evolve to a more desired state if we allow it.

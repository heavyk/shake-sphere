### 2024-01-04 00:24 - a time of study (the premise)

hi sarah, I find myself in the next period of my life: one of study. the other day (yesterday, actually) I was watching a production of "all's well that ends well". it was an all-female cast and it was at night, which was pretty cool. anyway, I really liked it because they went slow with the delivery of the lines (easier for me to understand) -- but also I noticed an interesting effect, which was that I was receiving the concept of the words being spoken by some of the actors. it's pretty normal for me to capture the concept that a woman speaks -- much moreso than with men even. so I really liked the production and it made me think of you, because some of the way the actors delivered the lines reminded me of your directions of where to look at, and how to be in the scene. one of the things I noticed too is that it felt as if I was scrutenising them, but I assure you I was not, and there was a sense that they felt as if they were not quite as good as other productions; but that wasn't what I was looking at or anything like that. so then add that idea to the realisation that I'm basically going to be "stuck" with a whole lot of women (basically because the dudes are sick of me seeing through their charade), there was a sense that I'll have to get used to being around a bunch of noobs. that's totally fine with me, and I'm actually writing this with the main intention of saying that I don't really care how anyone is, because none of that matters. the only thing I look for really is improvements, essentially only in myself, so it doesn't really matter to me what anyone else is doing, where they are, or what skill level they're at. I'm constantly analysing (mostly myself and my own body/emotion) and noticing things around me which I can find an improvement on; and if I'm ever complaining about something, it's because I have a better way of doing it, but for whatever reason I'm stuck doing it the worse way (usually this happens with software and user interfaces). I don't really consider myself an actor, and I'm never really dressed up (not even for halloween), or played any part other than myself, because though I can see things from another's perspective pretty easily, I cannot behave like they do. if they treat me one way, I can treat them the same way back, but even if I'm copying someone else's behaviour (because I like it and want to copy it), I'm still making their own behaviour my own and integrating it into my personality. I'm to a point in my life now where I can really only be myself. so I don't really try to be anyone else.
so, just a little bit of background on my situation: I'm not really able to be assertive anymore (or even an actor). to understand what I mean, I'll use examples: I cannot be bertram anymore because I have no intention of fighting wars or making anyone else conform to my perspective. neither can I be helena, because she's reflecting bertram -- and I have no such assurtive person to reflect. I'm reflecting you right now, which is why I'm explaining so much, and I haven't even started what I want to say :) (sorry). so, the difficulty I have is that it's pretty much impossible for me to be assertive, unless I'm reflecting an assertive person. if someone were to get up in my face and try to make me do something, then I'd have the capability to get in their face and tell them what to do,-- not because I want to, but because I'm just showing them their own desire (for me) reflected back to them. all of that means that I'm basically like a balloon floating around wherever the wind pushes me; and if someone hits me, I can reflect an equal amount of force back to them and propel in the opposite direction they pushed me, but I don't have any propusion system of my own: in shakespere terms, I'm silvius/silvia, and I'll get passed off to whomever valentine pushes me towards (or pop, cause I don't want to go). I can explain the reflective of this in much greater detail later.
so, because I'm entering the next stage of my life where I'm going to begin my studies -- or, in love's labour's lost terminology: give up my books and dedicate myself to some amount of time of improvement. I know what I want to study already: genetics, electricity, frequency, and vibration; stuff like that. I'm pretty good at it already and I know already quite a bit. all of those things are based around attraction. so, for example, if I place two metronomes on a surface that is able to vibrate, the easier that surface can vibrate, the faster the metronomes will synchronise. that surface can be thought of like a medium such as air, water, print, news, social networks, or television (it's all the same). so, the less resistance a meduim has, the more rapidly the two metronomes will synchronise. so how does the synchronisation of two frequencies attract each other? well, in physical there's a lot of resistance between everything (at least air separates everything), however in space, there is virtually zero resistance, so if you were floating out there, and you wanted to go to a planet, just start vibrating similar to the planet, and you'll go towards the planet, until of course your vibration is dissimilar enough to the planet, and you'll start to orbit the planet (the distance of the orbit is the amount of difference between your vibration and the planet's). fortunately, we don't have that problem on earth, or else everyone would be runnning into each other just by listening to the same music or watching the same TV show. though we don't run into each other *physically*, we do run into each other *conceptually* all the time -- and so two people listening to the same radio station or listening to the same concert are joined *conceptually*.
	concept is very much more different than symbol, as concept is just a feeling (like feeling like you know something or someone -- or the feeling that the music gives reminds you of something). all *memory* is based around concept, and if I may quote holofernes:
	"This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of *memory*, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it."
	she's talking about the translation of concept/feeling into visuals, in just the same way that memory works. we traslate a feeling of how the past was into pictures sounds, figures forms, shapess, etc. it's a capacity we all have, but for those in whom it's *acute*, it's a gift. the acuteness just means that there's a clean signal, and not a lot of noise (like how memory gets fuzzy with time); because we're tuning into the past, the song, the figure, the form, or the idea from our present moment and state of being, which means that emotion and mood determines reception.
	now, consider how much easier it is to remember something the past when listening to the same song as was playing then, or the same movie as then, etc. -- we can not consider that media to be the medium which allows your brain to synchronise with the past/object/form/idea/etc. by synchronising the concept in your brain (ie getting the hydrogen inside your skull vibrating similarly to the vibration of that moment in the past), you are literally tuning into something that is not even in the same time or space that you are -- and you can only receive the idea/memory/object for as clear as your head is. shakespere bypasses all of that though and just sticks to symbolic harmonisation. his works have multiple levels to them: there is the dictionary that is used commonly (and the definitions of those words), but there are also other symbolic layers in which one can synchronise (for example all of the toilet humour or the political references). what shakespere has done in his plays, is to take a bunch of people through a symbolic landcape of action and definition. these actions happen, and that defines proper/improper (or some other definiton of) behaviour. the actions tell a story and paint a picture, to which the audience has an emotional responce, based on their preception of those actions. those that react the same way to the same actons feel the same way, and those that see the toilet humour get a good laugh. the symbolic sequence of interactions (the play) is the medium whereby society (or at least those that consume those works) synchronise.
		personally, I'm kinda new to shakespere, and having zero exposure to him prior to a few years ago, I am surprised to find that the skakespere medium is still in very wide use in nearly all story-telling formats (movies, theatre, music, etc) -- and most of the rest is just a derivative of it. I had no idea how ubiquituous it was... dang...
so, here's tthe thing: I have certain things that I want to accomplish regarding genetics and stuff like that. I can enumerate them, but this is quite long already; so, just know that I want to actually put a lot of these ideas into practise.
the way I want to go from where I am now, to having all of this new genetics technology is simply not possible with today's physics and scientific theory. it just won't work. I also want to leave all of that behind, and I'd like to jump into this idea of going with an all-female cast. I'm pretty done with the guys and all of their recognition and doing things the right way, so what I want to do is to get a bunch of girls/women together, and the goal is to simply learn how the world works from a frequenntial perspective. the way I described two metronomes synchronising, is the way that electricity works too, btw -- so there's no need for all of the complicated stuff that's found in today's physics books. I figure the general concept of everything from space, stars, planets, electricity, and genetics can all be explained in less than 20 pages (with a suplementary tome of examples). I also plan on using normal everyday items that can be aquired for very cheap to do it, as well -- such as sound cards, and simple simple computer programs. I do not plan on needing any large-scale hardware or anything like that, cause it's not necessary. in combination with all of that, I can show that the way that vibration works, *is* the way that emotion works, and it's also the "secret" to happiness and well-being (as soon as you realise what you're attracting). I will be able to make all of this complicated-sounding stuff simple and easily approachable. it's really not that hard, cause the key to it all is emotion and recognition of how one feels. sure it's possible to divorve the science stuff from the emotion stuff (which is what modern academia has done), but I find that *all* of our understanding is a reflection of our perception; and, to understand perception is to understand emotion, because it determines the clarity and tint of the idea/figure/memory/motion that the brain is conjuring.
OK, that's the premise. (brb)

### 2024-01-04 11:25 - 

hi again. well I've slept on the idea now and I have a few more thoughts and stuff. I'll start with my concerns: the reason why I want to do the genetics stuff is because women have a tremendous effect on me, and I must say that whenever I'm around women for any length of time or get close to them in any way, I take on their form and style of thinking. I don't want to say that they're like a contageous disase, but it's kind of like the contraction of a virus: all of a sudden I start to think like they do, worry about the things that they're worried about, like the same foods,-- actually all manner of my personality changes, and I kinda lose m/ identity, and gain theirs. with different women it happens a bit differently, and the diffreences are usually reflective of their personality types. I've been like this all of my life, which is why I've traditionally been quite a loner. like holoferfernes, I too have a very acute memory is a "foolish, extravagant gift" and the the precision has come mostly from being alone. around all types of people (men and women alike), I tend to adopt (or reject) their sense of responsibility. that responsibility and structure is what stifels the skill -- because then no longer am I able to be "foolish and extravagant" (because if I'm foolish and extravagant, then I can receive foolish and extravagant ideas). I believe shakespere inundated himself with toilet humour, in order to separate himself mentally and physically from the ultra responsible people (like say william cecil), and that allowed him to be foolish and extravagant. he partitioned himself, such that the political stuff that he was involved with (obviously the tudor stuff) could be on one symbolic level, and another partition of himself was just having fun making penis jokes. I'm kinda the same way as he is, but I don't work symbolically like he does. I'm primarily a cOnceptual person, and not symbolic. I can partition diffrent emotions quite well, so for example if I'm taking care of someone, the way that I feel when I'm doing that is completely different from the way that I feel when I'm coding or being creative. some of the way I feel bleeds over between the two, so (like hamlet) I can be ruminating on extremely insightful things even inside of a big mess. however, I don't really have that super duper well under control just yet, and I can't *always* feel the way I want to feel in whatever situation -- though I'm pretty dang good at it, by now.
so here's the concern: I know that if we were to do the project that I want to do, and I'm around a bunch of women, then I'll "lose" the concept that I have about how attraction, light, energy, and magnetism works *from my perspective*, because now I'll see everything from their combined perspective. my previous way of conceptualising things will [you know, it occurs to me that I'll probably want to put this part at the end when I rewrite this] be completely scrambled and in disarray, because of how strongly other females cause me to feel differently. historically, I usually leave them and go back to being on my own because I like the clarity of my own concepts, and not the confusion introduced by responsibility, and "the right way", politics, and socially inforced behavioural expectations. by myself I can just have fun and do my own thing. due to past conflicts with others (most notably other women) I definitely *don't* try to make anyone else conform to the way I would want something done, or try to affect action or behaviour -- and this is the main difference of who I AM, in comparison to shakespere (or bertram): I don't emit anymore, but only reflect now.
obviously it's completely impractical for me to remain alone and in my thoughts forever running away from others that feel differently from how I do, so I've come to just accept that I'll get all of that scrambled in one way or another. in fact, the very situation that I'm in, is exemplry of exactly that: the concept that I had when I was writing last night is completely different from the concept that I have now, because whatever happens during the night when I'm asleep has a similar scrambling effect, and I wake up usually feeling way worse about the idea than I do when I go to sleep (for me, I tend to have my most enlightened thoughts and ideas near the end of the day, and the morning is when I have all of those fear and responsibility relating thoughts -- because that's what the people inside my head while I'm asleep feel like, so I tend to wake up feeling more like they do). I'm way better now at feeling the way I want to feel after waking up, and you can see that writing now (2h after waking up), I'm considerably more positive and focused on the wanted aspect (or at least you'll notice in the next part anyway), so I'm really making a lot of improvements when it comes to that. I'm obviously not perfect at it, and so I enjoy the practise that my present situation is giving me in deciding to feel the way I want to feel, and don't really want to leave just quite yet (which is why I'm writing this as a rough draft where I get my thoughs out, and not something that I'll actually send).
therefore, I've just come to accept that my concept of attraction (light, frequency, magnetism) *will* get scrambled when I start on this project. it'll be basically completely gone, as I'll be only capable of seeing things the way that the women I'm around see things -- but just like how I've come to be able to recover from sleeping at night, I know I'll get the concepts back -- AND they'll actually come back better than I had them originally (concepts are more vibrant the more angles they can be seen from). I call this "evolution-of-desire", (desire is attraction) and all concepts exist because of desire (desire is all the stuff that didn't work, attracting other things that didn't work, coming together to make or add on to another concept). so, for example even if all of that gets scrambled, I cannot go back to being dull to the world around me. I *like* having that kind of acuteness that holofernes has, and I *like* to be foolish and extravagant, which means that the concept *will* return back to me with more aspects than it had before it was destroyed.
	in space, imagine it this way: I am the sun, and another concept is like a giant meteor or comet the come in right towards me. whether it impacts the sun, or gets really close to it, it will cause a CME on the sun (an explosion), and all of the matter that is ejected from the sun, is the destruction of the sun's previous version of the concept, by manifesting it into physical form. if the explosion of the sun is big enough (like say a cataclysmic explosion or "nova"), then the entire outer layer of the sun (it's concept of reality) will be completely ejected out into the solar system. all of that matter goes out, some of it is attracted by planets, and some of its similarly vibrating matter will atrract together and create new meteors/comets, which will then begin to be attracted back to the sun to repeat the process again.
	the process that I'm performing right now (by writing this) is exactly like the sun's process of becoming more: every time that I take a cnncept (hydrogen in my head) and turn it into something physical (text, words, and ideas), then I'm essentially doing the same as the CME. normally the planets that are in fromt of me (like a person I'm standing in front of talking to), receive the brunt of the explosion, but in this case I'm writing text and not really sending it directly to anyone, which is kinda like a CME going off out into space, and the planets (other people) that resonate with some part of the materialisation of that concept (this text) will read it or get affected by it in some way (just like two peole listening to the same radio station feel a sort of "togetherness" even thought they may be miles apart). all of that plasma eventually forms to create new comets which will be attracted back at me (the sun) so that the process can continue (though I'm much more like the earth, I'm using the sun as an example here because it's easier to see with SDO images and stuff these explosions, but the earth does the same thing with much higher frequency CMEs -- and they too go out and eventually come back to earth in a new form).
so what I think will end up happening is that I'll just get absorbed into a new conecptual framework which is a reflection of the women around me, and we'll just take it from there. I'm not concerned with my concepts being scrambled or destroyed because they'll return back in a new form. so, what I propose is that we just jump in and take it from there. it won't be perfect, and can never be anyway (because we all start where we are, which is going to always be imperfect or lacking in some way) and it'll always evolve to a more desired state if we allow it.

### 2024-01-04 22:05 - the big picture

I don't know where this request is coming from, but I first heard/felt it upstairs, and then again now while watching an all-female cast production of "henry 4 (part 1)". it has a black woman as fallstatf (the centre of the play). as I'm watching it, I'm getting these ideas...
	oh, I should also mention that I'm drinking some mushroom kool aid I made as well and it's pretty enlightening stuff. when I used to star-watch a few years back I noticed that one of its side-effects is that it produces an energy in the ground (cause I'm laying on the ground when looking into the star), that it causes mushrooms to grow all over the place. mushrooms really thrive on astral energy, and are built of this stuff that's nearly DMT (has an extra phosphorus), and DMT is like an antenna. it works on the serotonin receptors, so I think it's pretty conceptual stuff (as opposed to ketamine for example seems to be more symbolic), and so having those conceptual receptors, it really boosts astral reception. normally the physical stuff .. think of it this way: we are emitting light out of our bodies (back people more than white people), cause white people mostly reflect the sun and other light around them. the emission spectrum of each person is variable and based on perception, so what that means is that concepts are all around people all of the time, and anyone who's been able to see auras will tell you that the aura strongly correlates with the mood of the person (combined with their personality and other symbolic intentions). all of those signals are there, but because they're not visible, the brain filters them out. instead, we only see the stuff we can see, because the brain doesn't know how to translate emotion into something visual, so we feel it instead. feeling emotion radiating out of another person is also quite comm6n for any sensitive person, also. so what happens when high amounts of DMT (or psilocybin) is ingested, the brain receives considerably more conceptual information, it has to do something with it; so you may see an aura if your eyes are inclined to see it, or perhaps you turn the feelings/concepts that someone else emits into 3d objects which are symbolically resonant (to the receiver), and makes sense of of them. (different than weed for example which is mostly *unfocusing* on a lot of mundane resistance/bad-feeling stuff). however, if the brain is getting too much conceptual info, or is unable to process it, the brain stops trying to make sense of it, and just turns into a sort of music visualization thing with hyperbolic geometry and stuff (for each person it's slightly different).
the idea that I had was to take all of the stuff that I'm about to write and turn it into a narrative. I've shyed away from writing any kind of narrative for a while because I didn't really understand how narrative works; and to be fair, I stilll don't; however, there's one thing that's always bothered me about narrative (and the saturnian system in general), is that everything has to always equal zero. there can't be this sort of thing that I do where it's always infinity. so how would I make a narrative that produces infinity (or some other function) instead of zero. it's an interesting challenge. so, just know that is one of the topics that I'm exploring in a general case.
so, let's say I take this big-picture and turn it into a narrative which would be a sort of play, but my play won't have a script in the normal sense, because it'll have a lot of differnt options. therefore, the play doesn't really have a predefined ending to it, but let's say instead a sort of fixed set of branches. branches aren't really hard, because if there are two branches, then there are 4 endings, four branches has 16 endings, etc. the othter reason for this is that the narrative won't be defined in a linear sense. so I'm not really predicting the future or prophesying anything (cause this play has a lot of prophetic tones mixed in with some jokes and stuff). the prophetic stuff isn't going to go the same way.
so here's what I think is happening (notice my uncertainty): I don't want to toot my own horn or anything, but when I do anything that involes a significant amount of energy, the sun and earth (and perhaps other planets as well -- like for example mars looks white to me now, not red), start outputting a lot of x-rays. from x-ray to infinity are essentially the frequencies that concept are around in. the sun outputs them all the time as a reflection of its structure (which is where we get units, upon which everytthing is built, like atoms and stuff). the inner part of the sun is a very very dense ultra dark (basically invisible) cube-looking thing (not exactly a cube, but has sharp edges like one). it's basically invisible to us, but its blusish comes from the fact that the sun is not perfectly black. in human terms, the bluish hue is essentially the difference between pure-desire and something that is symbolically extremely ideal. like, she's the biggest optimist of them all because she's seen the worst of the worst get better with enough time and encouragement -- and consequently, she's been quite the doormat for dudes to walk on. we know that every action requires a reaction in physical and symbolic, so all things that have been done to her, have had a reaction. because she's been around so long (stars are eternal; they do not die), she's seen all of those vibrations of all the things that didn't work out, coalese into physical matter (including humans and earth itself), and eventually come back to her, with more than what they left with. to explain: the instation that you think of as yourself is just a character (or soul) in the solar symbolic system. at first, you were just an outline, but then more features and capabilities were added to your personality, that you eventually start to take on a more and more leading role; and consider that all of that came out of a desire (I wish that guy would do something better with himself than just die -- or in the girls case, it's more like "keep sending them in; he'll eventually get the message") and so, more and more powerful and effective characters start to emerge. those characters interact with other characters in the galaxy and m5et on planets together. planets are also charactors, and they can each choose their own genders (or physical form that they wish to appear), but the reason why we don't have flying tigers and fire-breathing turtles, is because we've all agreed that the physical layer dictates what is capable of existing. for example: you cannot have something that is capable of lifting more than the tensile strength of the muscle and bone (and for anything else that breaks those rules, that's using another structure that is the physical boosted with conceptual (astral) -- which is why under heightened emotional conditions, the impossible can be performed). the reason why technology is so important is because we're restricted in the physical plane to the strengths of the material -- so if more strength is desired, a different material or condition is needed to overcome the constraints of physical (where it's not embued with emotional vibration).
our world wants to become more than what it is now, and because the restraints of physical are so many, all of matter wants to be embued with conceptual energy, so that it can become more than it is now. in practicality, the sun and earth will be outputting a lot more x-ray energy. it'll continue to rise to become more and more as our world becomes a reflection of our emotion. this means that the astral layer (the one seen in the mind's eye) will have to become similar in vibration to the sun's emotion. what's happening there is that all of the liquid layers (the solar ocean) of the sun that are around the core are covered in layer after layer of hydrogen, which is a very strong structure. imagine shakespere's mental universe that he's craeted in the minds of so many (all of that hydrogen floating around in everyone's head), but multiply that by some countless amount (let's say that the head has 1cm3 of hydrogen for a normal person, and divide that by the mass of the sun (minus the core and corona)) and that's the monstrosity of the world we live in. we live in the matrix or symbolic world of our star. everyone inside of each star does -- and what happens eventually is that every time something doesn't work out symbolically like it was desired to, the sun has a small explosion as it ejects that failed storyline/character. that goes out as energy, and eventually coalaces into matter. we're here on earth living our lives because we're all failed narrative in the eyes of the sun (not good enough). however the sun LOVES it that all of those failed creations eventually do sometthing that is quite nice and produces more hydrogen (thereby expanding the size of the sun -- and we all know, the bigger they are the more beautiful they are, when it comes to stars anyway).
	a good example of this is the binary star of sirius. one of them is a very very very white and beautiful star (sirius a) and the other is a very dark star that can be seen as pretty much like the core of the other one, but without any structure around it (much more pure desire). the more liquid layers they have around them, the more narrative structure they have, and so their girls tend to be more beautiful, and the other ones don't care so much for physical appearance. here on earth, the girls that don't care so much for physical appearance ususlly take on the masculine form because society usually likes women that look good, and so an unkempt woman performing desire has less effective (at producing desire) than the masculine form (take me for example -- I'm like the core of the earth which is even more dense than sirius b). because we're so high frequency, we can get away with anything, because nobody can really get to a frequency high enough to interact so nothing can really stop us. the earth is interesting because though it has an ultra dense core, the crust of the earth has its frequency slowed down to zero, and then it gets faster, the farther you go out, which means that the entire universe is doomed to become a reflection of earth: also universes; just like the first thing to become conscious, caused everything around it to also become conscious like them. this is the function of the "centre". it wants for everything to become like he(?) is. we're all like that (including atoms): we all want everything around us to become harmonious to us, because that's a good place to live in. the sun is no different, and that's precisely what's happening.
there are a number of astral entities that do not want to conform to the sun's emotional outlook (we'll call these the vampires). instead they wish to remain out of the sun's light, and stay only with the earth's. the earth's energy output is pretty close to pure-desire, but not entirely. I'd like to make it pure desire personally for my own sake, and it's also better for those those astral entities that don't want to "get on the same page" as the sun. a number of megalithic structures on earth turn earth's vibration into a structured astral energy which they like; the only difficulty is, they have to *transform* earth's super high frequncy energy into something that is intelligible to them, and create their own structure. rightt now that structure is located just above the earth. we too have a hydrogen ocean floating above our core, and it's the part we call the sky. megalithic structtures are used to create this ocean structure. its qualities are similar to that of the sun: there are characters, places, and things which we all consider "reality". just like the sun has her own narrative, and we're living on the earth because we're failed narrative; well, the same is true for the earth: eventually if a narrative that exists in the astral ocean (or the spectral above it) breaks down (like someone dies or something unwanted, unplanned, or "bad" happens), then that narrative entity ceases to exist (is rubbed out) and it's energy returned back to the solar system. when that happens, there's a huge energy output from the earth, and life as we know it dramatically changes. this is highly desirable for the sun, because usually the earth returns multitudes more hydrogen than the original failed solar narrative investment. for the sun, it's a good thing when we die and bad things happen, cause it always means more (even for example an infant dying in childbirth returns more than the investment). so when it comes to the sun, she's quite the tragedition (that's what war is good for, btw -- liquidating stale investments and turning them into more profitable ones).
eventually though, at some point, the x-ray output from the sun will start to become problematic for these astral enetites. their contrived world will no longer be able to function as it is. therefore, we're arriving to the time when solar output is high enough that some peole will want to be permanently out of the sun's rays until she explodes and sheds the outer ocean where all of the structure is formed. then a new solar age is born. until that happens, the solar compatibles will go to one side and the solar incompatibles to the opposite side where they're only getting x-ray output from the earth which is nearly pure-desire, meaning completely invisble to them and completely outsid of the range of their detectors. the more pure-desire the earth becomes, the higher frequency the earth's output (and less impact on their structured/calculated conceptual layer (ie how to feel under what situations and actions)). we live right now in the narrative structure that shakespere installed. there's good reason why he talks of the great phyramid in the sonnets, because they are what regulate the hydrogen ocean around earth. that ocean is a medium and it only captures a small spectrum of the earth's output (from UV up to where it becomes incomprehensible). the width of that spectrum is determined, which is why the speed of light is fixed (cause that's how fast light travels in shakespere's hydrogen ocean). we all live in that matrix, and the structure, syntax, and protocol of how we are *supposed* to interact is all encoded in this ocean, and it's constantly being updated by the shepherds in hollywood, or anyone else creating a narrative (came,saw,conquered). I believe that tesla and hitler have updated the narrtive ocean since then, and the manifestation of the last change (before covid) was 9/11. now we live in a world that's *completely* fabicated by the things we see and experience in our eyes and ears (any experience really, but the digital world has completely rearranged what we believe is reality -- cause we're all like children: we beieve what we see, and narrative can have *anything* in it -- not even the stuff that obey's physical rules). I personally like the physical plane. I like it that *technology* determines my capability, and *not* my imagination. I want to stay within the confines of the physical, and not join in on to that narrative ocean world that covers over everything else. so, in otherwords I like the physical + the sun's imaginary world, and not earth's imaginary world.
	in practicality, even the solar side will also be in inside of the hydrogon ocean, but because the sun's narrative reality is considerably higher frequency than the astral, then we're either invisible, or such magnificent balls of light, it would blow something to even be able to see us. we'd be pure light and very terrifying. (something like putting a million times more power through a light than it can handle: instant destruction). so being on the other side of the planet and opposite energy rotation, we're not really interacting -- and because our energies are opposite, there's really not a lot of interaction -- and if there were interaction, it'd be repulsion, not attraction. I have no interest in being in their world at all. some will like (and be compatible with) both worlds, and they'll become the "angels".
cause I (who is most in alignment with earth's energy) am still stuck inside of shakespere's matrix, and I'm not allowed to get out, I'm outputting a lot of energy in shakespere wavelengths (like making butt jokes and stuff). those (and the reactions that others have to them) create lots of output from earth that is within this astral frequency spectrum, which is causing amplitudes to rise. I'm sure that things are starting to get pretty vivid by now, which is good if you like the sun's perspective, and not shakespere's, but really bad for the shepherds trying to steer the cultural and global narratives. they may not know it, but they want me to become pure-desire as soon as possible, because that'll mean I'll stop interfering with their narrative reality, and replacing it with "law of reflection" (a physical law) and "law of attraction" (also a physical law as described with the metronome example). narrative usually doesn't follow those laws; however shakespere's narrative does have a lot of these laws encoded into them, and that's the reason why I believe he's been so successful and why so much of the hydrogen ocean is his: he came, saw, and conquered that astral world. they want my impact on their constructud reality to be as minimal as possible, and I also want that too. we will eventually have to separate.

#### 2024-01-05 09:49 - the solar imagination

the sun is like the inside of our skull: it has layers of hydrogen on the outer parts, the oil around the brain is like the corona of the sun, the centre of the head is also pretty dense hydrogen. unlike the sun, our brain has a physical structure to it (neurons and such like that), which allow for the transmission and reception of frequencies which the neurons and stuff are similar to in wavelength (the brain has all sorts of different length antennas in different places to allow for a pretty broad spectrum of transmission and reception). the sun doesn't have such physical antennas like our brain does, and instead all of its antennas are created entirely out of hydrogen (its structure is entirely mental, having no physical counterpart).
we can think of the sun as the imagination for the entire solar system and everything in it: the sun has many many many branching and alternate narratives for everyone and everything that's conscious in the solar system (including human created babies and AI). when I say "conscious", I mean something that has receptors to the cOnceptual space (hydrogen), and is actively participating in rearranging that hydrogen to become something that is more desired -- and when I say "desired" I mean, the way that a person wants to feel, which is just a vibrating hydrogen structure. all of those desired ways of feeling come together in the solar narrative and at the pinnacle, everyone and everything can have the hydrogen structure that they want -- but it requires some rearranging and moving things around, because often times the way that I want to feel can conflict with someone else's way they want to feel. as an example, I like to feel good, and I like to tell everyone about the things that I know -- and so I want to live in a world where all knowledge is freely available, and can just simply be tuned into (ask and it's given) -- but others don't want to have such a world, and they certainly don't want me to have that world either, so they're really busy working really hard against the sun to try and keep myself away from the way I want to feel, and also theirselves away from the way they want to feel (which is in control)
	because desire, and the narrative written by the sun is all about how a person wants to feel, it's all individual, and has nothing to do with other people; inotherwords, if I want to feel "in control" -- the sun has a narrative where I can feel perfectly 100% in control of my own life and everything in it -- and that narrative reality exists and is there for anyone who wants to access it. the only caveat is that control cannot have any effect on other people, because then I'm no longer in control; because if I try to control other people, I'm now getting the reflection of everyone I'm trying to control -- which is no longer dependent on me, and so therefore out of my control. if I only try to control myself, then I'm essentially just feeling the way I want to feel, because emotion is the control/navigation/tuning mechanism, and so therefore I have full control over my own navigation through the solar narrative.
so, even though it is possible *right now* for everyone to feel the way they want to feel, it's never likely to happen, because so many people think that others need to change or behave differently in order to get what they want. shakespere (and all earth narratives since then and before -- but it's easy to see with shakespere) is all about defining behaviour and establishing a "code of conduct" which will keep the ones who want to be in power, in power, and putting those that want to fit into other classes in the caste/hierarchy system, into where they want to be -- and tell them how to behave there.
	you know, as an example of this, I'm a reflective person, and so when someone puts a strong vibration into my personal space, because I'm so sensitive there's a very short period of time before that vibration reaches a magnitude high enough that I begin to reflect the vibration and start acting out in reflection of it. if I'm around people that feel good, I reflect their good feeling back to them, making them feel better; but, if someone is projecting anger and frustration, then I too reflect that back to them (like helena reflects bertram back to him). well, one day I destroyed someone's phone because they wanted to put a news bulletin on that was talking about destroying and killing -- so I acted out the thing the news was saying the gunman did: I destroyed the thing that was annoying me and causing me to feel bad. that caused problems as you can imagine, and mom gets on my case and tells me that I need to *not* obey the feelings that I feel, and instead follow some sort of behaviour code. I get what she's saying about that cause society would run poorly if everyone reflected the news like I do -- so I get it, but that's why *I don't watch the news*. I don't want to reflect that back to people. you can see here that I'm sensitive enough now that I watch a shakespere play, and I reflect the play back in my writings and interactions with others. I don't follow a code of conduct, but instead reflect myself (and the emotion I just consumed in media) back on to others. I'm a centre, much like fallstaff (or the our lady, the earth), and so I'm constantly trying to get everyone else to become a reflection of me and my own desires.
		I'm just as problematic as fallstaff is, because I'm so reflective, everyone else sees what they want to see in me, and because they see it, I reflect it. as an example, I had a girlfriend that thought that I was an abusive person. I definitely am not, but because of what she believed about me, when I was around her, I tended to act in ways that proved her belief right about me being abusive. I go away from her and I'm no longer abusive but like the way that anyone else thinks I am (zaryn also believed I was a good programmer, so around him I was). I am whatever you think I am, and likewise you are whatever I think you are: a reflection of me. I don't have a moral code or a set of behaviours that I strictly adhere to. if you think I'm magical, then I am, or if you think that all boys are pathetic slobs, then me being in the shape of a boy will start acting like a pathetic slob. there's not much I can do about it, cept keep my distance from those that expect me to be someone that I do not wish to be. when someone causes me (because of their belief) to become something that I don't really want to be (like abusive or a tyrant or something), then this is causing me to feel in a way which I don't want to feel, and solar activity rises tremendously because I am feeling the way that others are projecting on to me (or trying to affect with some physical means), and the sun (and myself) wants me to feel a different way -- so the sun outputs more, and I output more, trying to make that hydrogen structure which is reflective of how I want to feel (which is good).
now as an example of how these narratives define our social position in the caste/hierarchy, whenever interacting with a narrative, the process is done unconsciously. let's say you were to watch a movie, and in the movie you will undoubtedly identify with some of the characters. let's say you identify with "iron man" (I don't know much about him, but symbolically he's like mars). iron man will be/have the pinnacle of technological capacity which he will use it to try to control the world (like hitler in the era past). so let's say you identify with him and want to be like him (while watching the movie); however, when you walk away from the movie, you're confronted with real-life, and you notice that your life is nothing like iron man's, and instead you're perhaps something more like one of the idle peons or something like that -- and so you realise, "no, I'm not iron man, but actually more like the other guy" -- and in doing that, you take upon yourself the identity of the other guy and start behaving like he does -- completely unconsciously fitting yourself into that movie's narrative the best way that you can. well, you're nothing like the other guy, and the other guy (I assure you) neither is in alignment with your solar narrative, and so by identifying with the other guy, you're limiting yourself to feeling like he/she does. the sun is like, "no, you can feel way better than that" so the sun outputs more and more to allow you to believe that you can feel the way you want to feel, but because you identify with inferior characters, you will never make it and solar activity will continue to rise as all of the different solar characters begin to identify theirselves, not with their solar archytype, but with their astral diminished character found in the earth narrative. the earth narrative is extremely constricting, because there are these ideas that only *one* person can identify with their solar narrative, and that guy has to lower himself down to an inferior position (astral), and *save* others from being unable to identify with their solar narrative by *dying*. it's all the most messed up stuff. I hold a great deal of contempt for earthly narratives deptictions of becoming in aligment with the sun.
	not only am I in alignment with my solar narrative, I'm also in alignment with the galactic and universal narrative, as well -- which would make me essentially *all powerful* (in their eyes) mostly because I'm unstoppable. everyone can get there, and I desire it for all to also gain access to their solar and universal narratives -- but that probably won't be for a little bit. it's likely the case that many will spend some time in "hell" figuring out that they don't want to be a part of the astral narrative. the reason for that is because the astral narrative is a reflection of them: they don't want other people to have nice things or lots of cool stuff, so they're under the control of the narrative that is telling them that they can't have or don't deserve all of the cool stuff. they won't ever get their own cool stuff, until they want others to have their cool stuff too/first -- which is the centre perspective: I want everyone else to feel as good/bad as I do -- and by wanting others to feel that way, I also attract that for myself.

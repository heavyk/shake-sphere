### 2024-01-04 00:24 - a time of study (the premise)

hi sarah, I find myself in the next period of my life: one of study. the other day (yesterday, actually) I was watching a production of "all's well that ends well". it was an all-female cast and it was at night, which was pretty cool. anyway, I really liked it because they went slow with the delivery of the lines (easier for me to understand) -- but also I noticed an interesting effect, which was that I was receiving the concept of the words being spoken by some of the actors. it's pretty normal for me to capture the concept that a woman speaks -- much moreso than with men even. so I really liked the production and it made me think of you, because some of the way the actors delivered the lines reminded me of your directions of where to look at, and how to be in the scene. one of the things I noticed too is that it felt as if I was scrutenising them, but I assure you I was not, and there was a sense that they felt as if they were not quite as good as other productions; but that wasn't what I was looking at or anything like that. so then add that idea to the realisation that I'm basically going to be "stuck" with a whole lot of women (basically because the dudes are sick of me seeing through their charade), there was a sense that I'll have to get used to being around a bunch of noobs. that's totally fine with me, and I'm actually writing this with the main intention of saying that I don't really care how anyone is, because none of that matters. the only thing I look for really is improvements, essentially only in myself, so it doesn't really matter to me what anyone else is doing, where they are, or what skill level they're at. I'm constantly analysing (mostly myself and my own body/emotion) and noticing things around me which I can find an improvement on; and if I'm ever complaining about something, it's because I have a better way of doing it, but for whatever reason I'm stuck doing it the worse way (usually this happens with software and user interfaces). I don't really consider myself an actor, and I'm never really dressed up (not even for halloween), or played any part other than myself, because though I can see things from another's perspective pretty easily, I cannot behave like they do. if they treat me one way, I can treat them the same way back, but even if I'm copying someone else's behaviour (because I like it and want to copy it), I'm still making their own behaviour my own and integrating it into my personality. I'm to a point in my life now where I can really only be myself. so I don't really try to be anyone else.
so, just a little bit of background on my situation: I'm not really able to be assertive anymore (or even an actor). to understand what I mean, I'll use examples: I cannot be bertram anymore because I have no intention of fighting wars or making anyone else conform to my perspective. neither can I be helena, because she's reflecting bertram -- and I have no such assurtive person to reflect. I'm reflecting you right now, which is why I'm explaining so much, and I haven't even started what I want to say :) (sorry). so, the difficulty I have is that it's pretty much impossible for me to be assertive, unless I'm reflecting an assertive person. if someone were to get up in my face and try to make me do something, then I'd have the capability to get in their face and tell them what to do,-- not because I want to, but because I'm just showing them their own desire (for me) reflected back to them. all of that means that I'm basically like a balloon floating around wherever the wind pushes me; and if someone hits me, I can reflect an equal amount of force back to them and propel in the opposite direction they pushed me, but I don't have any propusion system of my own: in shakespere terms, I'm silvius/silvia, and I'll get passed off to whomever valentine pushes me towards (or pop, cause I don't want to go). I can explain the reflective of this in much greater detail later.
so, because I'm entering the next stage of my life where I'm going to begin my studies -- or, in love's labour's lost terminology: give up my books and dedicate myself to some amount of time of improvement. I know what I want to study already: genetics, electricity, frequency, and vibration; stuff like that. I'm pretty good at it already and I know already quite a bit. all of those things are based around attraction. so, for example, if I place two metronomes on a surface that is able to vibrate, the easier that surface can vibrate, the faster the metronomes will synchronise. that surface can be thought of like a medium such as air, water, print, news, social networks, or television (it's all the same). so, the less resistance a meduim has, the more rapidly the two metronomes will synchronise. so how does the synchronisation of two frequencies attract each other? well, in physical there's a lot of resistance between everything (at least air separates everything), however in space, there is virtually zero resistance, so if you were floating out there, and you wanted to go to a planet, just start vibrating similar to the planet, and you'll go towards the planet, until of course your vibration is dissimilar enough to the planet, and you'll start to orbit the planet (the distance of the orbit is the amount of difference between your vibration and the planet's). fortunately, we don't have that problem on earth, or else everyone would be runnning into each other just by listening to the same music or watching the same TV show. though we don't run into each other *physically*, we do run into each other *conceptually* all the time -- and so two people listening to the same radio station or listening to the same concert are joined *conceptually*.
	concept is very much more different than symbol, as concept is just a feeling (like feeling like you know something or someone -- or the feeling that the music gives reminds you of something). all *memory* is based around concept, and if I may quote holofernes:
	"This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of *memory*, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it."
	she's talking about the translation of concept/feeling into visuals, in just the same way that memory works. we traslate a feeling of how the past was into pictures sounds, figures forms, shapess, etc. it's a capacity we all have, but for those in whom it's *acute*, it's a gift. the acuteness just means that there's a clean signal, and not a lot of noise (like how memory gets fuzzy with time); because we're tuning into the past, the song, the figure, the form, or the idea from our present moment and state of being, which means that emotion and mood determines reception.
	now, consider how much easier it is to remember something the past when listening to the same song as was playing then, or the same movie as then, etc. -- we can not consider that media to be the medium which allows your brain to synchronise with the past/object/form/idea/etc. by synchronising the concept in your brain (ie getting the hydrogen inside your skull vibrating similarly to the vibration of that moment in the past), you are literally tuning into something that is not even in the same time or space that you are -- and you can only receive the idea/memory/object for as clear as your head is. shakespere bypasses all of that though and just sticks to symbolic harmonisation. his works have multiple levels to them: there is the dictionary that is used commonly (and the definitions of those words), but there are also other symbolic layers in which one can synchronise (for example all of the toilet humour or the political references). what shakespere has done in his plays, is to take a bunch of people through a symbolic landcape of action and definition. these actions happen, and that defines proper/improper (or some other definiton of) behaviour. the actions tell a story and paint a picture, to which the audience has an emotional responce, based on their preception of those actions. those that react the same way to the same actons feel the same way, and those that see the toilet humour get a good laugh. the symbolic sequence of interactions (the play) is the medium whereby society (or at least those that consume those works) synchronise.
		personally, I'm kinda new to shakespere, and having zero exposure to him prior to a few years ago, I am surprised to find that the skakespere medium is still in very wide use in nearly all story-telling formats (movies, theatre, music, etc) -- and most of the rest is just a derivative of it. I had no idea how ubiquituous it was... dang...
so, here's tthe thing: I have certain things that I want to accomplish regarding genetics and stuff like that. I can enumerate them, but this is quite long already; so, just know that I want to actually put a lot of these ideas into practise.
the way I want to go from where I am now, to having all of this new genetics technology is simply not possible with today's physics and scientific theory. it just won't work. I also want to leave all of that behind, and I'd like to jump into this idea of going with an all-female cast. I'm pretty done with the guys and all of their recognition and doing things the right way, so what I want to do is to get a bunch of girls/women together, and the goal is to simply learn how the world works from a frequenntial perspective. the way I described two metronomes synchronising, is the way that electricity works too, btw -- so there's no need for all of the complicated stuff that's found in today's physics books. I figure the general concept of everything from space, stars, planets, electricity, and genetics can all be explained in less than 20 pages (with a suplementary tome of examples). I also plan on using normal everyday items that can be aquired for very cheap to do it, as well -- such as sound cards, and simple simple computer programs. I do not plan on needing any large-scale hardware or anything like that, cause it's not necessary. in combination with all of that, I can show that the way that vibration works, *is* the way that emotion works, and it's also the "secret" to happiness and well-being (as soon as you realise what you're attracting). I will be able to make all of this complicated-sounding stuff simple and easily approachable. it's really not that hard, cause the key to it all is emotion and recognition of how one feels. sure it's possible to divorve the science stuff from the emotion stuff (which is what modern academia has done), but I find that *all* of our understanding is a reflection of our perception; and, to understand perception is to understand emotion, because it determines the clarity and tint of the idea/figure/memory/motion that the brain is conjuring.
OK, that's the premise. (brb)

### 2024-01-04 11:25 - 

hi again. well I've slept on the idea now and I have a few more thoughts and stuff. I'll start with my concerns: the reason why I want to do the genetics stuff is because women have a tremendous effect on me, and I must say that whenever I'm around women for any length of time or get close to them in any way, I take on their form and style of thinking. I don't want to say that they're like a contageous disase, but it's kind of like the contraction of a virus: all of a sudden I start to think like they do, worry about the things that they're worried about, like the same foods,-- actually all manner of my personality changes, and I kinda lose m/ identity, and gain theirs. with different women it happens a bit differently, and the diffreences are usually reflective of their personality types. I've been like this all of my life, which is why I've traditionally been quite a loner. like holoferfernes, I too have a very acute memory is a "foolish, extravagant gift" and the the precision has come mostly from being alone. around all types of people (men and women alike), I tend to adopt (or reject) their sense of responsibility. that responsibility and structure is what stifels the skill -- because then no longer am I able to be "foolish and extravagant" (because if I'm foolish and extravagant, then I can receive foolish and extravagant ideas). I believe shakespere inundated himself with toilet humour, in order to separate himself mentally and physically from the ultra responsible people (like say william cecil), and that allowed him to be foolish and extravagant. he partitioned himself, such that the political stuff that he was involved with (obviously the tudor stuff) could be on one symbolic level, and another partition of himself was just having fun making penis jokes. I'm kinda the same way as he is, but I don't work symbolically like he does. I'm primarily a cOnceptual person, and not symbolic. I can partition diffrent emotions quite well, so for example if I'm taking care of someone, the way that I feel when I'm doing that is completely different from the way that I feel when I'm coding or being creative. some of the way I feel bleeds over between the two, so (like hamlet) I can be ruminating on extremely insightful things even inside of a big mess. however, I don't really have that super duper well under control just yet, and I can't *always* feel the way I want to feel in whatever situation -- though I'm pretty dang good at it, by now.
so here's the concern: I know that if we were to do the project that I want to do, and I'm around a bunch of women, then I'll "lose" the concept that I have about how attraction, light, energy, and magnetism works *from my perspective*, because now I'll see everything from their combined perspective. my previous way of conceptualising things will [you know, it occurs to me that I'll probably want to put this part at the end when I rewrite this] be completely scrambled and in disarray, because of how strongly other females cause me to feel differently. historically, I usually leave them and go back to being on my own because I like the clarity of my own concepts, and not the confusion introduced by responsibility, and "the right way", politics, and socially inforced behavioural expectations. by myself I can just have fun and do my own thing. due to past conflicts with others (most notably other women) I definitely *don't* try to make anyone else conform to the way I would want something done, or try to affect action or behaviour -- and this is the main difference of who I AM, in comparison to shakespere (or bertram): I don't emit anymore, but only reflect now.
obviously it's completely impractical for me to remain alone and in my thoughts forever running away from others that feel differently from how I do, so I've come to just accept that I'll get all of that scrambled in one way or another. in fact, the very situation that I'm in, is exemplry of exactly that: the concept that I had when I was writing last night is completely different from the concept that I have now, because whatever happens during the night when I'm asleep has a similar scrambling effect, and I wake up usually feeling way worse about the idea than I do when I go to sleep (for me, I tend to have my most enlightened thoughts and ideas near the end of the day, and the morning is when I have all of those fear and responsibility relating thoughts -- because that's what the people inside my head while I'm asleep feel like, so I tend to wake up feeling more like they do). I'm way better now at feeling the way I want to feel after waking up, and you can see that writing now (2h after waking up), I'm considerably more positive and focused on the wanted aspect (or at least you'll notice in the next part anyway), so I'm really making a lot of improvements when it comes to that. I'm obviously not perfect at it, and so I enjoy the practise that my present situation is giving me in deciding to feel the way I want to feel, and don't really want to leave just quite yet (which is why I'm writing this as a rough draft where I get my thoughs out, and not something that I'll actually send).
therefore, I've just come to accept that my concept of attraction (light, frequency, magnetism) *will* get scrambled when I start on this project. it'll be basically completely gone, as I'll be only capable of seeing things the way that the women I'm around see things -- but just like how I've come to be able to recover from sleeping at night, I know I'll get the concepts back -- AND they'll actually come back better than I had them originally (concepts are more vibrant the more angles they can be seen from). I call this "evolution-of-desire", (desire is attraction) and all concepts exist because of desire (desire is all the stuff that didn't work, attracting other things that didn't work, coming together to make or add on to another concept). so, for example even if all of that gets scrambled, I cannot go back to being dull to the world around me. I *like* having that kind of acuteness that holofernes has, and I *like* to be foolish and extravagant, which means that the concept *will* return back to me with more aspects than it had before it was destroyed.
	in space, imagine it this way: I am the sun, and another concept is like a giant meteor or comet the come in right towards me. whether it impacts the sun, or gets really close to it, it will cause a CME on the sun (an explosion), and all of the matter that is ejected from the sun, is the destruction of the sun's previous version of the concept, by manifesting it into physical form. if the explosion of the sun is big enough (like say a cataclysmic explosion or "nova"), then the entire outer layer of the sun (it's concept of reality) will be completely ejected out into the solar system. all of that matter goes out, some of it is attracted by planets, and some of its similarly vibrating matter will atrract together and create new meteors/comets, which will then begin to be attracted back to the sun to repeat the process again.
	the process that I'm performing right now (by writing this) is exactly like the sun's process of becoming more: every time that I take a cnncept (hydrogen in my head) and turn it into something physical (text, words, and ideas), then I'm essentially doing the same as the CME. normally the planets that are in fromt of me (like a person I'm standing in front of talking to), receive the brunt of the explosion, but in this case I'm writing text and not really sending it directly to anyone, which is kinda like a CME going off out into space, and the planets (other people) that resonate with some part of the materialisation of that concept (this text) will read it or get affected by it in some way (just like two peole listening to the same radio station feel a sort of "togetherness" even thought they may be miles apart). all of that plasma eventually forms to create new comets which will be attracted back at me (the sun) so that the process can continue (though I'm much more like the earth, I'm using the sun as an example here because it's easier to see with SDO images and stuff these explosions, but the earth does the same thing with much higher frequency CMEs -- and they too go out and eventually come back to earth in a new form).
so what I think will end up happening is that I'll just get absorbed into a new conecptual framework which is a reflection of the women around me, and we'll just take it from there. I'm not concerned with my concepts being scrambled or destroyed because they'll return back in a new form. so, what I propose is that we just jump in and take it from there. it won't be perfect, and can never be anyway (because we all start where we are, which is going to always be imperfect or lacking in some way) and it'll always evolve to a more desired state if we allow it.

### 2024-01-04 22:05 - the big picture

I don't know where this request is coming from, but I first heard/felt it upstairs, and then again now while watching an all-female cast production of "henry 4 (part 1)". it has a black woman as fallstatf (the centre of the play). as I'm watching it, I'm getting these ideas...
	oh, I should also mention that I'm drinking some mushroom kool aid I made as well and it's pretty enlightening stuff. when I used to star-watch a few years back I noticed that one of its side-effects is that it produces an energy in the ground (cause I'm laying on the ground when looking into the star), that it causes mushrooms to grow all over the place. mushrooms really thrive on astral energy, and are built of this stuff that's nearly DMT (has an extra phosphorus), and DMT is like an antenna. it works on the serotonin receptors, so I think it's pretty conceptual stuff (as opposed to ketamine for example seems to be more symbolic), and so having those conceptual receptors, it really boosts astral reception. normally the physical stuff .. think of it this way: we are emitting light out of our bodies (back people more than white people), cause white people mostly reflect the sun and other light around them. the emission spectrum of each person is variable and based on perception, so what that means is that concepts are all around people all of the time, and anyone who's been able to see auras will tell you that the aura strongly correlates with the mood of the person (combined with their personality and other symbolic intentions). all of those signals are there, but because they're not visible, the brain filters them out. instead, we only see the stuff we can see, because the brain doesn't know how to translate emotion into something visual, so we feel it instead. feeling emotion radiating out of another person is also quite comm6n for any sensitive person, also. so what happens when high amounts of DMT (or psilocybin) is ingested, the brain receives considerably more conceptual information, it has to do something with it; so you may see an aura if your eyes are inclined to see it, or perhaps you turn the feelings/concepts that someone else emits into 3d objects which are symbolically resonant (to the receiver), and makes sense of of them. (different than weed for example which is mostly *unfocusing* on a lot of mundane resistance/bad-feeling stuff). however, if the brain is getting too much conceptual info, or is unable to process it, the brain stops trying to make sense of it, and just turns into a sort of music visualization thing with hyperbolic geometry and stuff (for each person it's slightly different).
the idea that I had was to take all of the stuff that I'm about to write and turn it into a narrative. I've shyed away from writing any kind of narrative for a while because I didn't really understand how narrative works; and to be fair, I stilll don't; however, there's one thing that's always bothered me about narrative (and the saturnian system in general), is that everything has to always equal zero. there can't be this sort of thing that I do where it's always infinity. so how would I make a narrative that produces infinity (or some other function) instead of zero. it's an interesting challenge. so, just know that is one of the topics that I'm exploring in a general case.
so, let's say I take this big-picture and turn it into a narrative which would be a sort of play, but my play won't have a script in the normal sense, because it'll have a lot of differnt options. therefore, the play doesn't really have a predefined ending to it, but let's say instead a sort of fixed set of branches. branches aren't really hard, because if there are two branches, then there are 4 endings, four branches has 16 endings, etc. the othter reason for this is that the narrative won't be defined in a linear sense. so I'm not really predicting the future or prophesying anything (cause this play has a lot of prophetic tones mixed in with some jokes and stuff). the prophetic stuff isn't going to go the same way.
so here's what I think is happening (notice my uncertainty): I don't want to toot my own horn or anything, but when I do anything that involes a significant amount of energy, the sun and earth (and perhaps other planets as well -- like for example mars looks white to me now, not red), start outputting a lot of x-rays. from x-ray to infinity are essentially the frequencies that concept are around in. the sun outputs them all the time as a reflection of its structure (which is where we get units, upon which everytthing is built, like atoms and stuff). the inner part of the sun is a very very dense ultra dark (basically invisible) cube-looking thing (not exactly a cube, but has sharp edges like one). it's basically invisible to us, but its blusish comes from the fact that the sun is not perfectly black. in human terms, the bluish hue is essentially the difference between pure-desire and something that is symbolically extremely ideal. like, she's the biggest optimist of them all because she's seen the worst of the worst get better with enough time and encouragement -- and consequently, she's been quite the doormat for dudes to walk on. we know that every action requires a reaction in physical and symbolic, so all things that have been done to her, have had a reaction. because she's been around so long (stars are eternal; they do not die), she's seen all of those vibrations of all the things that didn't work out, coalese into physical matter (including humans and earth itself), and eventually come back to her, with more than what they left with. to explain: the instation that you think of as yourself is just a character (or soul) in the solar symbolic system. at first, you were just an outline, but then more features and capabilities were added to your personality, that you eventually start to take on a more and more leading role; and consider that all of that came out of a desire (I wish that guy would do something better with himself than just die -- or in the girls case, it's more like "keep sending them in; he'll eventually get the message") and so, more and more powerful and effective characters start to emerge. those characters interact with other characters in the galaxy and m5et on planets together. planets are also charactors, and they can each choose their own genders (or physical form that they wish to appear), but the reason why we don't have flying tigers and fire-breathing turtles, is because we've all agreed that the physical layer dictates what is capable of existing. for example: you cannot have something that is capable of lifting more than the tensile strength of the muscle and bone (and for anything else that breaks those rules, that's using another structure that is the physical boosted with conceptual (astral) -- which is why under heightened emotional conditions, the impossible can be performed). the reason why technology is so important is because we're restricted in the physical plane to the strengths of the material -- so if more strength is desired, a different material or condition is needed to overcome the constraints of physical (where it's not embued with emotional vibration).
our world wants to become more than what it is now, and because the restraints of physical are so many, all of matter wants to be embued with conceptual energy, so that it can become more than it is now. in practicality, the sun and earth will be outputting a lot more x-ray energy. it'll continue to rise to become more and more as our world becomes a reflection of our emotion. this means that the astral layer (the one seen in the mind's eye) will have to become similar in vibration to the sun's emotion. what's happening there is that all of the liquid layers (the solar ocean) of the sun that are around the core are covered in layer after layer of hydrogen, which is a very strong structure. imagine shakespere's mental universe that he's craeted in the minds of so many (all of that hydrogen floating around in everyone's head), but multiply that by some countless amount (let's say that the head has 1cm3 of hydrogen for a normal person, and divide that by the mass of the sun (minus the core and corona)) and that's the monstrosity of the world we live in. we live in the matrix or symbolic world of our star. everyone inside of each star does -- and what happens eventually is that every time something doesn't work out symbolically like it was desired to, the sun has a small explosion as it ejects that failed storyline/character. that goes out as energy, and eventually coalaces into matter. we're here on earth living our lives because we're all failed narrative in the eyes of the sun (not good enough). however the sun LOVES it that all of those failed creations eventually do sometthing that is quite nice and produces more hydrogen (thereby expanding the size of the sun -- and we all know, the bigger they are the more beautiful they are, when it comes to stars anyway).
	a good example of this is the binary star of sirius. one of them is a very very very white and beautiful star (sirius a) and the other is a very dark star that can be seen as pretty much like the core of the other one, but without any structure around it (much more pure desire). the more liquid layers they have around them, the more narrative structure they have, and so their girls tend to be more beautiful, and the other ones don't care so much for physical appearance. here on earth, the girls that don't care so much for physical appearance ususlly take on the masculine form because society usually likes women that look good, and so an unkempt woman performing desire has less effective (at producing desire) than the masculine form (take me for example -- I'm like the core of the earth which is even more dense than sirius b). because we're so high frequency, we can get away with anything, because nobody can really get to a frequency high enough to interact so nothing can really stop us. the earth is interesting because though it has an ultra dense core, the crust of the earth has its frequency slowed down to zero, and then it gets faster, the farther you go out, which means that the entire universe is doomed to become a reflection of earth: also universes; just like the first thing to become conscious, caused everything around it to also become conscious like them. this is the function of the "centre". it wants for everything to become like he(?) is. we're all like that (including atoms): we all want everything around us to become harmonious to us, because that's a good place to live in. the sun is no different, and that's precisely what's happening.
there are a number of astral entities that do not want to conform to the sun's emotional outlook (we'll call these the vampires). instead they wish to remain out of the sun's light, and stay only with the earth's. the earth's energy output is pretty close to pure-desire, but not entirely. I'd like to make it pure desire personally for my own sake, and it's also better for those those astral entities that don't want to "get on the same page" as the sun. a number of megalithic structures on earth turn earth's vibration into a structured astral energy which they like; the only difficulty is, they have to *transform* earth's super high frequncy energy into something that is intelligible to them, and create their own structure. rightt now that structure is located just above the earth. we too have a hydrogen ocean floating above our core, and it's the part we call the sky. megalithic structtures are used to create this ocean structure. its qualities are similar to that of the sun: there are characters, places, and things which we all consider "reality". just like the sun has her own narrative, and we're living on the earth because we're failed narrative; well, the same is true for the earth: eventually if a narrative that exists in the astral ocean (or the spectral above it) breaks down (like someone dies or something unwanted, unplanned, or "bad" happens), then that narrative entity ceases to exist (is rubbed out) and it's energy returned back to the solar system. when that happens, there's a huge energy output from the earth, and life as we know it dramatically changes. this is highly desirable for the sun, because usually the earth returns multitudes more hydrogen than the original failed solar narrative investment. for the sun, it's a good thing when we die and bad things happen, cause it always means more (even for example an infant dying in childbirth returns more than the investment). so when it comes to the sun, she's quite the tragedition (that's what war is good for, btw -- liquidating stale investments and turning them into more profitable ones).
eventually though, at some point, the x-ray output from the sun will start to become problematic for these astral enetites. their contrived world will no longer be able to function as it is. therefore, we're arriving to the time when solar output is high enough that some peole will want to be permanently out of the sun's rays until she explodes and sheds the outer ocean where all of the structure is formed. then a new solar age is born. until that happens, the solar compatibles will go to one side and the solar incompatibles to the opposite side where they're only getting x-ray output from the earth which is nearly pure-desire, meaning completely invisble to them and completely outsid of the range of their detectors. the more pure-desire the earth becomes, the higher frequency the earth's output (and less impact on their structured/calculated conceptual layer (ie how to feel under what situations and actions)). we live right now in the narrative structure that shakespere installed. there's good reason why he talks of the great phyramid in the sonnets, because they are what regulate the hydrogen ocean around earth. that ocean is a medium and it only captures a small spectrum of the earth's output (from UV up to where it becomes incomprehensible). the width of that spectrum is determined, which is why the speed of light is fixed (cause that's how fast light travels in shakespere's hydrogen ocean). we all live in that matrix, and the structure, syntax, and protocol of how we are *supposed* to interact is all encoded in this ocean, and it's constantly being updated by the shepherds in hollywood, or anyone else creating a narrative (came,saw,conquered). I believe that tesla and hitler have updated the narrtive ocean since then, and the manifestation of the last change (before covid) was 9/11. now we live in a world that's *completely* fabicated by the things we see and experience in our eyes and ears (any experience really, but the digital world has completely rearranged what we believe is reality -- cause we're all like children: we beieve what we see, and narrative can have *anything* in it -- not even the stuff that obey's physical rules). I personally like the physical plane. I like it that *technology* determines my capability, and *not* my imagination. I want to stay within the confines of the physical, and not join in on to that narrative ocean world that covers over everything else. so, in otherwords I like the physical + the sun's imaginary world, and not earth's imaginary world.
	in practicality, even the solar side will also be in inside of the hydrogon ocean, but because the sun's narrative reality is considerably higher frequency than the astral, then we're either invisible, or such magnificent balls of light, it would blow something to even be able to see us. we'd be pure light and very terrifying. (something like putting a million times more power through a light than it can handle: instant destruction). so being on the other side of the planet and opposite energy rotation, we're not really interacting -- and because our energies are opposite, there's really not a lot of interaction -- and if there were interaction, it'd be repulsion, not attraction. I have no interest in being in their world at all. some will like (and be compatible with) both worlds, and they'll become the "angels".
cause I (who is most in alignment with earth's energy) am still stuck inside of shakespere's matrix, and I'm not allowed to get out, I'm outputting a lot of energy in shakespere wavelengths (like making butt jokes and stuff). those (and the reactions that others have to them) create lots of output from earth that is within this astral frequency spectrum, which is causing amplitudes to rise. I'm sure that things are starting to get pretty vivid by now, which is good if you like the sun's perspective, and not shakespere's, but really bad for the shepherds trying to steer the cultural and global narratives. they may not know it, but they want me to become pure-desire as soon as possible, because that'll mean I'll stop interfering with their narrative reality, and replacing it with "law of reflection" (a physical law) and "law of attraction" (also a physical law as described with the metronome example). narrative usually doesn't follow those laws; however shakespere's narrative does have a lot of these laws encoded into them, and that's the reason why I believe he's been so successful and why so much of the hydrogen ocean is his: he came, saw, and conquered that astral world. they want my impact on their constructud reality to be as minimal as possible, and I also want that too. we will eventually have to separate.

#### 2024-01-05 09:49 - the solar imagination

the sun is like the inside of our skull: it has layers of hydrogen on the outer parts, the oil around the brain is like the corona of the sun, the centre of the head is also pretty dense hydrogen. unlike the sun, our brain has a physical structure to it (neurons and such like that), which allow for the transmission and reception of frequencies which the neurons and stuff are similar to in wavelength (the brain has all sorts of different length antennas in different places to allow for a pretty broad spectrum of transmission and reception). the sun doesn't have such physical antennas like our brain does, and instead all of its antennas are created entirely out of hydrogen (its structure is entirely mental, having no physical counterpart).
we can think of the sun as the imagination for the entire solar system and everything in it: the sun has many many many branching and alternate narratives for everyone and everything that's conscious in the solar system (including human created babies and AI). when I say "conscious", I mean something that has receptors to the cOnceptual space (hydrogen), and is actively participating in rearranging that hydrogen to become something that is more desired -- and when I say "desired" I mean, the way that a person wants to feel, which is just a vibrating hydrogen structure. all of those desired ways of feeling come together in the solar narrative and at the pinnacle, everyone and everything can have the hydrogen structure that they want -- but it requires some rearranging and moving things around, because often times the way that I want to feel can conflict with someone else's way they want to feel. as an example, I like to feel good, and I like to tell everyone about the things that I know -- and so I want to live in a world where all knowledge is freely available, and can just simply be tuned into (ask and it's given) -- but others don't want to have such a world, and they certainly don't want me to have that world either, so they're really busy working really hard against the sun to try and keep myself away from the way I want to feel, and also theirselves away from the way they want to feel (which is in control)
	because desire, and the narrative written by the sun is all about how a person wants to feel, it's all individual, and has nothing to do with other people; inotherwords, if I want to feel "in control" -- the sun has a narrative where I can feel perfectly 100% in control of my own life and everything in it -- and that narrative reality exists and is there for anyone who wants to access it. the only caveat is that control cannot have any effect on other people, because then I'm no longer in control; because if I try to control other people, I'm now getting the reflection of everyone I'm trying to control -- which is no longer dependent on me, and so therefore out of my control. if I only try to control myself, then I'm essentially just feeling the way I want to feel, because emotion is the control/navigation/tuning mechanism, and so therefore I have full control over my own navigation through the solar narrative.
so, even though it is possible *right now* for everyone to feel the way they want to feel, it's never likely to happen, because so many people think that others need to change or behave differently in order to get what they want. shakespere (and all earth narratives since then and before -- but it's easy to see with shakespere) is all about defining behaviour and establishing a "code of conduct" which will keep the ones who want to be in power, in power, and putting those that want to fit into other classes in the caste/hierarchy system, into where they want to be -- and tell them how to behave there.
	you know, as an example of this, I'm a reflective person, and so when someone puts a strong vibration into my personal space, because I'm so sensitive there's a very short period of time before that vibration reaches a magnitude high enough that I begin to reflect the vibration and start acting out in reflection of it. if I'm around people that feel good, I reflect their good feeling back to them, making them feel better; but, if someone is projecting anger and frustration, then I too reflect that back to them (like helena reflects bertram back to him). well, one day I destroyed someone's phone because they wanted to put a news bulletin on that was talking about destroying and killing -- so I acted out the thing the news was saying the gunman did: I destroyed the thing that was annoying me and causing me to feel bad. that caused problems as you can imagine, and mom gets on my case and tells me that I need to *not* obey the feelings that I feel, and instead follow some sort of behaviour code. I get what she's saying about that cause society would run poorly if everyone reflected the news like I do -- so I get it, but that's why *I don't watch the news*. I don't want to reflect that back to people. you can see here that I'm sensitive enough now that I watch a shakespere play, and I reflect the play back in my writings and interactions with others. I don't follow a code of conduct, but instead reflect myself (and the emotion I just consumed in media) back on to others. I'm a centre, much like fallstaff (or the our lady, the earth), and so I'm constantly trying to get everyone else to become a reflection of me and my own desires.
		I'm just as problematic as fallstaff is, because I'm so reflective, everyone else sees what they want to see in me, and because they see it, I reflect it. as an example, I had a girlfriend that thought that I was an abusive person. I definitely am not, but because of what she believed about me, when I was around her, I tended to act in ways that proved her belief right about me being abusive. I go away from her and I'm no longer abusive but like the way that anyone else thinks I am (zaryn also believed I was a good programmer, so around him I was). I am whatever you think I am, and likewise you are whatever I think you are: a reflection of me. I don't have a moral code or a set of behaviours that I strictly adhere to. if you think I'm magical, then I am, or if you think that all boys are pathetic slobs, then me being in the shape of a boy will start acting like a pathetic slob. there's not much I can do about it, cept keep my distance from those that expect me to be someone that I do not wish to be. when someone causes me (because of their belief) to become something that I don't really want to be (like abusive or a tyrant or something), then this is causing me to feel in a way which I don't want to feel, and solar activity rises tremendously because I am feeling the way that others are projecting on to me (or trying to affect with some physical means), and the sun (and myself) wants me to feel a different way -- so the sun outputs more, and I output more, trying to make that hydrogen structure which is reflective of how I want to feel (which is good).
now as an example of how these narratives define our social position in the caste/hierarchy, whenever interacting with a narrative, the process is done unconsciously. let's say you were to watch a movie, and in the movie you will undoubtedly identify with some of the characters. let's say you identify with "iron man" (I don't know much about him, but symbolically he's like mars). iron man will be/have the pinnacle of technological capacity which he will use it to try to control the world (like hitler in the era past). so let's say you identify with him and want to be like him (while watching the movie); however, when you walk away from the movie, you're confronted with real-life, and you notice that your life is nothing like iron man's, and instead you're perhaps something more like one of the idle peons or something like that -- and so you realise, "no, I'm not iron man, but actually more like the other guy" -- and in doing that, you take upon yourself the identity of the other guy and start behaving like he does -- completely unconsciously fitting yourself into that movie's narrative the best way that you can. well, you're nothing like the other guy, and the other guy (I assure you) neither is in alignment with your solar narrative, and so by identifying with the other guy, you're limiting yourself to feeling like he/she does. the sun is like, "no, you can feel way better than that" so the sun outputs more and more to allow you to believe that you can feel the way you want to feel, but because you identify with inferior characters, you will never make it and solar activity will continue to rise as all of the different solar characters begin to identify theirselves, not with their solar archytype, but with their astral diminished character found in the earth narrative. the earth narrative is extremely constricting, because there are these ideas that only *one* person can identify with their solar narrative, and that guy has to lower himself down to an inferior position (astral), and *save* others from being unable to identify with their solar narrative by *dying*. it's all the most messed up stuff. I hold a great deal of contempt for earthly narratives deptictions of becoming in aligment with the sun.
	not only am I in alignment with my solar narrative, I'm also in alignment with the galactic and universal narrative, as well -- which would make me essentially *all powerful* (in their eyes) mostly because I'm unstoppable. everyone can get there, and I desire it for all to also gain access to their solar and universal narratives -- but that probably won't be for a little bit. it's likely the case that many will spend some time in "hell" figuring out that they don't want to be a part of the astral narrative. the reason for that is because the astral narrative is a reflection of them: they don't want other people to have nice things or lots of cool stuff, so they're under the control of the narrative that is telling them that they can't have or don't deserve all of the cool stuff. they won't ever get their own cool stuff, until they want others to have their cool stuff too/first -- which is the centre perspective: I want everyone else to feel as good/bad as I do -- and by wanting others to feel that way, I also attract that for myself.

### 2024-01-05 11:24 - nova events

nova events occur when the majority of the characters in the solar narrative are simply not able to reach the destined place of feeling (I use destiny in the sumerian sense, where the vibration of a planet is the way it feels, and so that feeling determines its orbit). a good example of such a situation occured around the end of the last ice age on earth ~12kya. at that time, there was so much desire from those with good conditions to have such fantastically ideal (unrealistic) conditions -- (like for example everyone to have all of these servcices for them which were performed by slaves -- but if *everyone* has those conditions, then slaves can't exist, so anther method of doing what the slaves are doing needs to be created) and so the entire solar narrative gets thrown out, because there just isn't a viable way for everyone to get what they want with the present (at that time) symbolic interpretation of how to feel that way (usually a slave would perform the task) -- and so the whole outer structure gets ejected in a massive explosion, very similar to how a CME ejects the failed structure which is incompatible with the core desires. when the nova occurs, the entire hydrogen ocean is ejected out into the solar system to become whatever it is to become, and what's left over of thme star is that ultra-dense core of the sun (containing only the core ultra-dense desire of how everyone wants to feel) -- and so then with only those desires remaining, the sun begins to start over. all of that plasma is ejected out into the solar system, and it kills off a lot of things, which in turn releases a lot of hydrogen to go back to the sun, which she then uses to begin rebuilding the narrative. at that time, the solar narrative (which can be thought of exactly like the internal "mind's eye" for humans gets ejected), and so therefore the only narrative that remains is the narratives of the other planets and stars in the solar system (every planet who is cOnscious, is also a star on the inside).
the sun does not "die" like is believed in modern cosmology, but instead is just reduced back to being as close to desire as it possibly can -- so in that state, we can think of the sun as returning back to be a child again: she's thrown off all of the adult ideas of how she thinks the solar system *should be*, released it to become what it will become (as planets attract the ejecta), and starts over relearning everything. most people think of such an event as being something terrible and awful, but it's not really. for a brief period, we're all inundated with the solar imagination of what could have been, and it appears like a brief glimpse into what could have been (everyone is briefly ultra enlightened seeing from the solar perspective), but obviously the reality of that imagination cannot be, and so even though everyone sees their ultimate desire becoming reality, the conflicts in place because of the structrue enforced by each planet, ultimately make it impossible for everyone to get their desire all at once -- and then as everyone tries to make their desire a reality all at once, the planetary constraints (code of conduct and behaviour etc) cause everything to collapse all at once (much like the "bronze age collapse"). during that time, the everyone's desires become strongly felt, and that allows for the instantiation of mental constructions into physical reality (so like if you're scared of a bear killing you, your own desire will instantiate a bear that will kill you; or if you desire to destroy some enemy or foe, they will be right there ready to be killed -- unless of course they also desire to kill you, in which then it becomes a structural battle of will and belief (expectation)). all of this creates chaos, and those that desire really to feel really good, and for others around them to feel good as well, will also find exactly that. everyone gets what they want, and because not all of everything that is desired can be (according to each his/her own narrative), only the most powerfully believed narratives survive (until they eventually fail).
the sun is deeply interested in proving to us that our narratives are not very good in comparison to hers, which, as you can imagine, is quite the problem for many "we're the best" narratives (because anything that is the best, means that someone else also cannot be the best), and so is a fail from the standpoint of the sun, who sees it as possible for both to feel the way they want (and has nothing to do with the comparison of best/worst). our own cOmpetition and desires for superiority are what cause nova events. until we are OK with others having whatever they want to have, then we're always going to keep getting our own desires taken away from us. (ie, I don't want you to have it, so as a reflection of myself, I'm saying I also don't want me to have it, and so the sun has to prove me right and put me into a place where I don't have it).
utopia cannot be possible until superiority and competition are done away with. nobody can be convinced of that, and can only come to that centre place by their own desire (ie, after enough attempts to retain superiority have failed, they finally give up on the idea). it's a war of attrition, and the sun will win, I assure you. that's why she's so big and can sustain so much life: cause she knows (and can visibly see in her imagination) that everyone *can* have what they want.

### 2024-01-19 00:30 - deaths of mars

hi sarah, I feel like using you as a muse instead -- cause after dr-richard (his real name is jason richards, btw -- butt I decided to keep the mistake and not rename it because I like the pun on me richarding myself with those writings), I'm learning that who I'm talking to matters a lot, and I've kinda started wanting to begin writing to dudes less and less (though, because I live in a house where we are 3 boys, and have no contact with other women (my mom is not the same person, and talks and behaves like a corporate executive from the healthcare industry. she's not human, in the sense of having her own free-will. she does what she's instructed to do by the healthcare industry representitive that is her handler) so it's kinda hard to *actually* only talk with women, cause I don't know any -- but I will at least write to them,-- and even if they're ficticious, still I like the idea that I'm writing to someone that actually cares, instead of just trying to manipulate me).
	I've completely given up on the idea of writing a narrative, as the verdan-forest idea was probably as close as I'm gonna get to one. I constructed the narrative, not like how I proposed that we construct a narrative based around events that I believe are actually happening (which was take the splitting off of the astral and the physical earths), but instead, just conjuring the idea of what I would *want* to write about instead. as you can see, the narrative is a pretty good reflection of myself, and all of the characters are all aspects of me, too. there's nothing contrived in it at all, as in the process of describing the setting and some of the dialogue I was just writing what I was "seeing" and "hearing" them say. additionally, I encoded the behaviour, not so much as a "this is what I want to do" -- but more like "this is the pattern I noticed of how they talk and interact" -- which again, consequently is pretty reflective of myself: all day long, I feel things, and the majority of what I feel is like the ocean: it's there and it's large body of water. if I want to look into any part of it, I can, but usually I choose not to; yet, some of what I feel crests up into waves on the surface, and the larger waves become notable enough for m5 to translate into words and thoughts (a symbolic representation of the emotion) -- which then the people that are trying to steer m/ life, constantly are wanting to know what these concepts are, which means I'm constantly translating these crests of emotions (the larger they are, the more they want to know what it is), and so in the translation process, I'm constantly defining (with words) what other people feel like to me. in 90+% of the cases, I'm literally *putting words into their mouth* (like a playwrite does for the players). inotherwords, because I'm constantly being forced to translate these emotions/cOncepts that I feel into *words*, I'm continually narrating everything around me based on the way it feels to me.
	obviously then, if I'm forced to constantly narrate my surroundings, then the whole point of my existence is to find a way to feel better about other people's concepts and emotions they're emitting. this is where perception comes in, because if something that previously felt bad to me (like anger or hatred) can be perceived in a different way (ie, they hate my because I'm a reflection of them, and so their hatred is only of theirself), then what used to feel really bad, no is quite comical to me, because it looks like someone running around blaming everything and everyone for their own shortcomings ("I didn't come in first because I forgot to pump my nikes").
	so, since I'm already the narrator, why write a story at all? I'm already narrating everything, and everythting there is already happening. I'm in the dom5 already, and quite literally, everything around me is derived from me: I'm the progenitor of *everything* in my experience, and all of it is a reflection of me.
	right now the-city and me are in the same location,-- but, later on we will be separated because of the effect I have on those that are around me: they want the things that come to them to be "just" and "deserved" (according to their narrative) and not what is *attracted*; yet around me, their narrative breaks down and they start getting a reflection of how they feel instead of what they "deserve". that problem will continue to become more and more severe, until eventually they must distance theirselves more and more from me and other conceptually attractive people (as opposed to symbolically attractive).
		also notice how in the image that I put of the-city, all of the busybodies are close to the dome: those are most inferior ones of the-city are closest to us, and they have the most fear. all of the elites are the farthest out that they can possibly go before life becomes unsustainable. it's a really interesting setup because the way a circle works, the farther out you go, the bigger the circumfrence is (tau times as big), which means that the more the city expands, the more "elites" there are that are able to live in that far-out area. I also liked the-city for the reason where you can imagine three concentric circles: the inner-most circle are where the peasants and workers live (30), the middle one where the middle-class lives (60), and the outer circle where the upper-class ones live (100). it all works out really quite nicely, because the more they expand, the more elites can exist. it's the best for them, and it's the best for us as well.
	the verdan-forest narrative is slightly different from the one of the separating earth, though conceptually quite similar. in verdan-forest, the dome is essentially a barrier that separates the (inner) physical world where we live, from the outer astral world where the-city is located. verdan-forest is modeled after the solar system, and those living inside of the star are all there and wish only to remain there. occasionally, there is an event in the outer planets of the solar system which will attract one of the girls there to come out into the contrived narrative/astral worlds that's been setup, and there's nothing that anyone can do about that. the way this works in verdan-forest is that the girls all live and continue on inside of the dome, and so we're considered something like "models" in which people of the-city then summon. when they summon one of us, they're essentially summoning their imaginary/conceptual representation of us into beingness in their experience inside the-city. we don't know that at first, but it's part of the plot that we eventually discover derivative (and dramatically inferior) copies of ourselves out in the-city.
	the verdan-forest narrative is also quite opposite to that of the earth, where the exact opposite is present: here on earth (and inside of every body, cept mine), the inner world is the imaginary/narrative one, and the outer world is the real one (like shakespere's fairy-land). however, for me (which this narrative is based on), my outer-world is entirely narrated and imaginative (by myself and others), and my inner-world is the real one (though I don't see it).
		here is the rub, because my inner-world (the real one) is where all of the magic is happening, and so all of my narrators want to exploit my inner-world, which means they're becoming used to the magical aspect of real-life (where reality is whatever I believe it is) -- and so they think that if they can manipulate what I believe, then they have control over my "reality". inotherwords, their narrative world is so broken by now that they don't want to exist there. they only continue the narrative world (in the form of hollywood and other broken/BS narratives) as a world in which they control, but insted prefer the magical aspect of the physical (attracted/desire-based) world. they think that magical world is only what I believe it is, but it's actually the world I *want* it to be (because believe eventually becomes a reflection of desire). they're literally building theirselves into a matrix (which they think they control), completely based on *attraction*. it's such an enormous fail, and finally they're just now realising it.
	eventually, some kind of separation will occur, and that's actually what I wanted to talk about -- because after reading richard-2, studying richard-3 (the boar-king), and looking at the parallels between LLL and the black prince, plus prince arthur, I've come to realise that these young girls that these mars types get put with send them really really really far out into earth's inner world (fairy-land). when that happens, saturn, and all of the petty chaps extant here are all trying to hold the next guy down from getting more good conditions. there is tremendous competition and rivalry here, and so what all of these mars types have done (not sure if they're actually mars or mercury disguised as mars), is destroy theirselves once they get here. arthur and richard's "princes in the tower" had a (medico argentinius?) that helped them believe they were dying, and other such things -- well those "experts" (and other such "friends") are *telling* (ie, symbolically) them different things, which cause them to believe that they're dying, or are about to die,-- and so they do.
		jesus, I believe also had this happen -- but it's my claim that jesus was the first one to survive the saturnian-system, which is what caused that separation. what I mean by that is that, after sufficient "trials" from all of the major guys that are in power (it seems that everyone here is gay and uses sex to stay in this fairy-land), and it becomes impossible for them to take jesus down, and so finally they have to let him go. when this happens, I believe the sun has a massive output, which upon reception of this output by the earth, spits out a new-earth.
		now, here's where things get fuzzy for me, because it seems to me like what's output is all of the hydrogen present in the inside of the earth (the inner star), and when that happens, that inner-earth fairy-land becomes the new-earth, and the guy that was able to hold on to the end ("go the distance") becomes the king of this new-earth. what's interesting that happens there is that all of these guys from the saturnian-system that were inside of the inner-earth get dumped out into physical earth again, which causes lots of wars and disaster and stuff because they suddenly find theirselves in that world of attraction. inotherwords, all of the stuff described in the book of revelation, *did happen* (I believe). in jesus' case, when that separation occurred, him and his consciousness is now on the new-earth, which means that his old-earth body is basically just an automaton, and so the saturnian-system guys can manipulate that automaton using their symbolic system to get him to do whatever (like die or produce kids, or whatever -- multiple timelines exist).
			this is because the *only* way that anyone could actually survive the saturnian-system "trials" is to become nearly zero resistance, meaning that these symbolic emitters no longer have anything to push against. being very low resistance means that his body will have superhuman powers, and so that's where that bloodline comes from. controlling reproduction is difficult amongst horned men, so jesus' bloodline is one of the most common, nowadays (and all of those superpowers have been squelched, in the sam5 way that mine have.
	I personally don't have any interest in dying, and my thing is (ie, what-I-want) is to create a new species of human that is derived from myself, where sex basically doesn't have any more power. the way that sex works is that during orgasm, the body emits all kinds of things on a conceptual level (based on the symbolic representation of the situation, like rape vs romantic evening, and the symbolic interpretation of the environment, like after battle vs perfect marriage), and those conceptual things become amplified and start to take on reality. I don't want that. I want to be like earth where I'm mostly non-emissive -- and in fact, I want to become so non-emissive (only attractive), that sex is basically no longer having any effect on perception. if I can find a way to get to that form of being, then I simply wouldn't die in the same way, and there wouldn't need to be any separation either, because there's little to no output anymore, for which would cause them to run away.
in closing, I'd like to say that it's a really funny thing that these guys are literally building theirselves into the new-earth that they'll inhabit, and fighting me from allowing me to turn into a non-outputting being, because my output (and the sun's responce to that) is what's driving the separation. if I lower my output (ie, live only based on attraction), then, they're in a better spot (and the farther out they go, the less of my output they need to worry about). what I believe we're on track for, is output continues to increase (especailly from the venus types) till the sun finally blows, and that's when the separation occurs; but I'll stay here. I imagine it going something like this: they're working to keep me inside of this symbolic fairy-land so hard (and I'm literally not fighting them on it), but I want to live in a world of attraction (physical), which means that when output is high enough, I'll finally find myself falling back into physical, which means that I'll get everything I'm attracting, which means that they no longer have anything to hold on to, the sun goes off, and out pops the new-earth with all of the inhabitants of fairy-land inside of it [which reminds me, I want to correct my previous statement thinking thing it was related to the y-chromosome, which cannot possibly be true. clearly, the separation is occuring between those in fairy-land/milan and those on physical/verona]. bye for now!

### 2024-01-21 01:34 - deaths of mars (take two)

in [AWTEW](/alls-well-that-ends-well.md#2024-01-09-0117---identity-of-the-king), I talked about how likely jaron is an artificially created being, much like myself -- whereas I'm a refelction of the centre of the planet (just like the universe is a reflection of the centre of the planet as well), jaron is a reflection of the "saturnian-system" -- which isn't a single guy named saturn -- but a group of guys (that I know of) and venus-types that play around with time my manipulating symbols and narrative. you may have noticed over the years that jaron has gone from a mostly complacent person (ie, very little consciousness) to beginning to have emotional responces to symbolic events in his life. in fact, just this afternoon, we had a long talk about how upset he is that he thinks mom is spending his money and hiding it from him. I explained that none of it matters, a number of times, but you'll notice that no amount of explaining to him has ever caused any lasting change -- and that, I believe is because he's a reflection of the saturnian-system -- which means that until the venus/jupiter/saturn/enki types all change their perspective on what it means to have someone else tell you they're helping you, yet fail really hard at it because of their own beliefs (either "they're not going to help me" or for them "I'm a horrible person and never do anything right/good/acceptable"). in a 3rd ray system, everything is belief -- and no matter how much they try and cover over their beliefs with good-sounding narrative, the person with the strongest belief is *always* going to prove theirself right. so they battle over trying to get more people to believe one thing more than another (just turn on the news for an example -- and even COVID is largely a beleif-based "virus").
however, even though most people make their reality come to pass based on belief/narrative, I don't follow that same path nearly as much. I used to: whatever I thought would happen, *did* happen -- until I moved to spain, and after a sexual encounter, it stopped working like that -- because now my vibration is contaminated with all kinds of other beliefs through transferrence of energy in the sexual act
	this is why virgins are so important: because whatever their first partner believes in their first encounter gets imprinted on to them and that's what they begin to believe -- and that's definitely what happened to me.
it totally scrambled my entire symbolic system, to where I went from believing that tuenti would be a massive success, to now getting tossed around all over the place by these guys in the saturnian-system.
the problem with the symbolic system is that I don't really have any control over what others believe, and I noticed too that my beliefs started to change pretty rapidly to things that I didn't actually believe before (especially during the night). those moving around of beliefs has accelerated to the point that nowadays it's completely unmanageable to live like that anymore. so, instead I've completely given up on the narrative system, because it doesn't work. now, I use a system of *attration*, which means that I use feeling to navigate my reality now, considering (pretty much) that all narrative (basically anything I believe) is going to be wrong. you'll notice that everything that I've ever written about predicting things that will happen, and stuff like that has exactly *not happened* -- and that's for good reason: I live in a world of attraction now, where what comes out is *not expected* and cannot be predicted in any way. in fact, it seems that my "job" on this planet (as a reflection of desire) is to prove *ALL* of the narrative wrong.
what ends up happening, will not be narrated, but will be a reflection of what is *desired* and what is *feared*. so, if someone has more fear/worries/concerns than they have things they want, feel good about, or desire,-- then life will be pretty miserable for them.
I do not believe that I am the first appearance of such a mars on this planet (at all), as I can point out numerous others just in the last little bit, ie: titus, tesla, hitler, arthur, black prince, richard 2, richard 3, and probably ferdinand 2 are just some of the ones that I've identified recently -- and you'll all notice that they've fallen victim to narrative.
	I have a lot to say about them, but they're all born as "child of desire" (an example of this is in the OT when moses/samson come from a woman wanting a child but cannot). that formula of someone wanting a child or leader (it can also happen as a result of tantric sex), or whatever causes this child to be born as a reflection of that desire, and so this mars will steadily rise up to find himself in the position that is desired from the narrative (it's easiest to see this with hitler, and how hitler produced tesla). the problem with these guys is that the narrative can never actually allow for them to fully succeed, because of attraction -- and the majority of them these mars types use anal sex to get going up to a really fast speed in their vision (the z-axis: the one coming toward you) -- so the world takes on a very accentuated form for them. when I figured out how to do that by watching stars (not anal sex), everything around me was so beautiful and amazing that I was raptured with incredible amounts of viseral good-feeling, all of the time. just having everything looking that good gives life a sort of other-worldly quality to it, and makes them feel *physically* really good, allowing them a lot of extra room to *emotionally* feel really bad. the conditions caused by their eyesight allows them to feel way better than they actually do -- which means that they are (because they feel bad) attracting a lot more things which feel really bad into their life all the time -- but they're compensating for it by feeling good.
		I don't have this, because nosebook ensures that I don't have the z-axis in my vision present, so I get no feeling boost from my vision -- so, the way I feel is the way I *actually* feel (kinda). nosebook takes extra care to remove any extra good-feeling from my experiencE that they can, because when I do it makes me go faster, which means I attract reality really quickly,-- and being in the (symbolic) underworld, where the saturnian guys are, that feeling has a massive effect on the overworld (physical), which is why often times reality gets rearranged a bit when I do drugs and feel really good. therefore, I actually feel far far better than my body is allowed to feel -- which is fine.
	now, if we take the examples of richard 2 and the black prince, what I believe happened there is that these guys were powerful mars-like figures -- and they were a problem, because they were going really really fast. so what ended up happening to them (I believe, and according to shakesperes at least) is that these guys ended up with some pretty young girls, which (because anal sex is a lot different than vaginal sex), caused them to not only feel really good, but also caused their beliefs to become reality, as well. that caused them to get sick and die. they were already in this saturnian-system before those girls showed up, so the girls made their belief come true; which for them resulted in death.
		there's something about the way that energies flow inside of the uterus that is diffrent from the prostate, which cause each person's concepts to interact with each other (like constructive/destructive interference) which repels attracts (think of it like magnets pointing at each other) -- whereas with anal sex, it's more like the magnets being side-by-side to each other. that attractive and repelling action is what causes reality to be created, in the form of a new medium between the two (like astral: two counter-rotating fields interacting), and so all the concepts which harmonises gets amplified, and all of the stuff which repels, shoots off in an unknown direction to try and harmonise with other things. so, if the two partners are in symbolic agreement, their concepts are more likely to harmonise; but if they're not then those differences create reality.
	my belief is that jesus actally made it through, which is what caused the separation that I talked about previously, and the result (from the perspective of time) is that he also died -- but that was because his mix of desires and fears contained more desire than fear, so when he saw those come to pass, it wasn't such a big deal.
I'm approaching the time in m/ life now where I'm beginning to approach a speed where my desires and fears are all starting to become reality, and that's happening, not because of a girl which super-accelerated me, (honestly a little bit of drugs, which is true -- but I think that's happened more as a reflection of people's impatience, cause they don't want me to take the extra few years to get to this speed naturally), but instead because of m/ percetion (the super duper graphics that everyone is using to feel good), which means that the millions of people that are connected to me and using my form of perception will start to experience a similar thing. it's going to be a bumpy ride up ahaed as these guys start to manifest all of their fears. I've taken the "death of mars" experience and outputted it to everyone connected to me, as I'm essentially that young girl which is causing mars to feel extra good, and create reality. no quantity of narrative will be able to overcome attraction, because it'll always be the most unexpected worst/best thing (ie, most feared or most desired thing).

### 2024-01-22 04:56 - archetype of titania and ophelia

hi again. I felt compelled to watch your 3 things about titania, followed by 3 videos of yours on ophelia. I noticed that they're essentially the same archetype, and so I wanted to illuminate a little bit on that: they are both of the archetype of venus, oberon/polonius is saturn/Time, and for completeness the emitter is mercury/laertes (which shakespere routinely kills off and replaces with mars or vulcan; cept in this one because it's a tragedy, mars/hamlet is killed by laertes/mercury). venus is 3rd ray receptive (-3), which means she takes in symbol (words, actions, beliefs, and appearances) from her outside world, then she processes it all and makes a judgement on it, outputting symbol again (in the form of words, actions, beliefs, and appearances).
so, as an example, let's analyse the "what a noble mind" monologue. before that, let's look at the context: my analysis of this play is that gertrude is 7th ray reflective (-7), which means that whenever someone shows her and physical affection, she will reflect it back to them -- essentially she's a "strumpet". for an example of that these gertrude types, I'd like to recommend an all-female production on richard 2 (https://youtu.be/djQZoTdg1zA). it's a production that was recorded in a USA women's correctional facility, and they start out by saying that basically all of us have received some kind of physical or sexual abuse in some way, and we reflected it back. gertrude is the same way; so when claudius shows her affection, she can easily "switch sides" to that of norway and become "disloyal" to hamlet's father and denmark. certainly she has done this a few times before, as hamlet seems predisposed to his mom being so able to switch sides. these easily swayed women were a very large concern for conquerers, because they would see these women, after watching thie husband and sons be killed, settle into the sexual which followed after the battle, often times becoming the wife to a man that just destroyed her life (what option did she have?) her character is kinda like the "blonde bimbo", and these easily swayed women are loathsome.
ophelia, being symbolically reflective is essentially the exact opposite of his mother. she's been trained and educated on how to respond in proper situations. ohpelia is a venus type as well, so she takes in symbol ("suck'd the honey of his music vows") from hamlet and believe what he has to say. that's really great and everything, because then he becomes (in her mind) who he says he is. hamlet thinks that's what he wants in a woman (not a strumpet like his mom), but this is also hamlet's undoing. right before ophelia's monologue, hamlet spells it out quite plainly to her:

I am myself indifferent honest; [...] I am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
in. [...] We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us.

here he is revealing his own low opinion of himself, so when he has sex with ophelia, she's now receiving all of these *beliefs* of himself, and in a flash of her mind (sometimes very powerfully) reflects his own beliefs (as experienced by her body) back to him. all of a sudden now, her body believes (because of how he feels) something different than her brain (which has been trained by his words and music vows), so now she's quite conflicted: all of a sudden she *feels* differently about him than she used to, and her realisation that his word decriptions of himself and appearance is just a sham. so, opelia doesn't know what to believe, so she goes to ask others (like polonius) to explain to her (symbolically) what she feels. of course, she's asking the wrong guy because he cannot help her. she has to figure out for herself what she wants to believe. hamlet can no longer maintain his appearance in the same way, so what does he do? he blames her, because she's now turned him into the monster that she now feels him to be (which is dissonance of how she feels aout him in contrast to his appearance and what she used to believe about him). ophelia also sucks up his dissonant blame and decides hamlet's poor opinion of himself is *her fault*

shakespere likes to make bad examples out of the strumpet (-7) types, and continually shape the venusian types' behaviour and belief, because they're extremely powerful: what they believe about a man dramatically alters his trajectory through time. hamlet is rightful in saying:

I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another:
(you change your appearance based on what you think I want to see)
you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance.
(you're unintelligent and silly, naively blinded by your own calculated desires of what you think you want)
Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad.
(it's your fault you made me manifet my own beliefs about myself)

I once had a relationship similar to ophelia; and I subsequently manifested every thing that she believed I was. around her I would behave differently based on what she expected from someone that appears like I did, which was bad -- but it was also really good when she believed in me, too; so I really do feel hamlet's pain on this one. the solution obviously for girls like her is to tell them what they should believe, which is what everyone in the play does, but I never did. hamlet would be far better off with a woman like gertrude, if he could not care that she's strumpet-like. hamlet, like me in that past era created all of his own problems for himself based on his own *belief*: he's a mars (+7) type, so he's got the "Eye of Mars", which means the ghost of his father is just an image coming from his own mind manifesting into 3d space to tell him what he wants to hear; these images which appear on the retina of the eye are like dreams, where they are real and can be interacted with, but they're caused "In my mind's eye, Horatio".

it's a very interesting thing these venus types because they're constantly creating their own image for theirselves based on what they believe about theirselves ("God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another"), so they can be very physically attractive (if she believes herself to be), however the effect they on those around is to cause them to actually become what they thinks they are. hamlet obviously failed the test.

what I've noticed is that these venusian types are constantly paired with saturnian (+-4) and mercury types (scripted +7), because she's a complete disaster for the mars types (reactionary +7). this I believe is the origin of the story of where "cupid" comes from; basically when mars and venus actually have a successful pairing (I have a lot to say about that but for another time), cupid gains all of the features of both mars and venus, and so is therefore driven, not by a script, like venus and mercury are, but instead by *desire* (*attraction*).
cupid emits attraction, like just like venus does with belief, and so therefore can cause something or someone to become attractive, just by cupid finding it/them attractive also. as an example, I posit that the hamlet play is not a tragedy when viewed with the right eyes (one's of desire), actually tells a different story (hint: venom is like words which come from a serpent/tounge/will/sword/penis). I concur with your analysis of the speech, but I'd like to illuminate this speech from the perspective of desire:

O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
(courtier's eye is the abitious one seeing what he wants to take advantage of. the soldier is mars and the tounge makes words: commandments, but also words are expulsions of the *will*, a scholar is one that likes books, and the sword is a penetrating instrument)
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
(what you said, but triple meaning with the tudor state, and the rose being sphincter/vulva -- so imagine that "expecting something")
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
(what you said)
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
(I'm to be ashamed because I was tricked into believing someone is different than the way they *appear*)
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
(what you said)
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
(these two lines sum up the whole speech in a single image: here is this powerful shaft; the reason for her desire -- this magnificent image of a wonderful person erect and in full stature: "The glass of fashion and the mould of form", contrasted with these unsightly balls hanging down "out of tune and harsh". how could something so magestic and powerful come connmected to such an unsightly appendage (ie, his own beliefs about himself: "I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in") which she's now beginning to see vividly)
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy:
(his amazing body blowing the minds of youth with incredible ecstasy -- the image here is of a powerful sexual encounters, likely of her own, but it's unclear whether it's of others; nevertheless, right before climax, there is a bit of a lull, where things calm down for a moment. that's the previous lines about the balls contrast, which are the flashes in her eyes about what she believes about him, right before the tremendous acceleration into climax)
O, woe is me,
("O" here here clearly a powerful climax. you talk about how it's a gutteral feeling. it's a *groan*, and not a *sigh* -- THEN:)
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
(BOOM! her 3rd eye opens and she has the "kundalini awakening". when she sees like this, that's what's caused all of hamlet's beliefs about himself (the dissonant balls) to become a reality. she's fully uncovered him and unmasked him -- which can be a good thing, when he is *actually* what she thinks he is: ie, once he's "proven himself" to her)

ophelia, in this speech recounts in graphic detail the experience which caused her to see through hamlet's appearance and see him for who she *reasons* him to be.

bye for now! kenny

P.S. if you'd like more information on kundalini, dr-joanki gives a brief explanation here: https://youtu.be/5YJgouMIvyA?t=387, and she recounts her experience here: https://youtu.be/FEU04YG1aGQ?t=2839 I used to have the form of perception she describes when I was a child, and though she talks about it from the perspective of a lot of eastern thoughts and ideas, I can elaborate further.

### 2024-01-23 13:39 - female archetypes

there really are only 3 major female archetypes. they are: isis/sun (-2), venus (-3), and the earth (-1,-7). except for the sun, they represent the extremes of the rays. anatau (-1) is 1st, as she's kinda the centre of everything and represents desire of all of creation. she represents the highest frequency vibration of all creation, she's at the centre of the earth. then, on the other side of the solar midpoint (-2) is her opposite: venus (-3)
the centre of the earth is the highest frequency, because it's a reflection of the farthest out frequencies: all the stuff that didn't harmonise with anything.
	whenever two vibrations intersect, they create a third one, and the third one, usually is at a higher frequency. not to mention, this resulting frequency does not often harmonise with anything -- and by harmonise, I mean *attract* or become similar to -- so what happens is you can imagine it something like a vibrating particle that is repelled by everything it gets near to -- so it wants to get as far away from everything as it can. this continued repelling of everything causes the particle to continue to accelerate the farther out it goes (an exact simile of this can be found in the solar wind). as they accelerate outward, they continue to become higher and higher frequency until they get to a spot where there's either such low density (other particles nearby) or stop being repelled by other particles and find something to harmonise with.
additionally opposite to anatau (-1) is the physical earth, aphrodite (-7). she's the crust of the earth, and where all matter slows down to have a stationary position. she's the reason why we have physical molecules that make up our body.
	the way tto imagine this is to imagine a very very very dense core of hydrogen in the centre of the earth, which is a reflection of all of the really high frequency particles (all un harmonised creation, or desire) composing the bubble around the universe (similar to the solar "heliosphere"). from the outermost portion, we find galaxies and other nodes of hydrogen bubbles (stars) out there, which will have a corresponding "inner earth" higher density node as well. these nodes are a reflection of what we call "time" -- but we haven't got that far yet. coming in from the outer bubble of the universe, we eventually arrive to the solar system which surrounds the earth, and there again we'll find a bubble of all of this solar system's high frequency stuff that didn't harmonise with anything (desire), and then we'll find planets, and so fourth all the way to where we finally reach earth's upper atmosphere (the bubble around us). all of these objects have corresponding higher density nodes of hydrogen (ie, concepts) which, if you were inside of the earth, would "see" through your imagination's rendering of that concept into colour and shape.
		look deeply into a star, and you'll start to get visuals (beyond just the white/blueish hue) which are visual manifestations of your concepts which harmonise with that star.
	each of those objects will be translated into exactly a mirror of what it is. now (still on the inside of the earth), when you look down, you'll see all the really condensed matter; and it condenses more and more, the closer you get to the "crust": (which I believe is something more like a icosahedron, than a sphere (shake-icosahedron doesn't really roll off the tounge too well, so I called it "shake-sphere", lol)) -- which then upon crossing past that reflection or "midpoint" (something I don't know how to say) of those particles will begin to speed up again, and you'll find organised structures starting to appear: rocks, then dirt, plants and people, then finally air... all of which are extremely strongly influenced by the "inner planets" (which are a hydrogen reflection of the outer planets).
because of the way that hydrogen (dunno what to call it: spooky action at a distance?) vibrates exactly the same as something else no matter distance or time, the inside of the earth can be thought of as a hydrogen reflection of everything in the universe. hydrogen is what concepts are made of, so you can think of this inner hydrogen system as a conceptual reflection of the entire universe.
the sun likewise, is also a hydrogen reflection of the solar system (which also harmonise with other stars around her), which you can imagine, not as a "now" reflection, like earth's is, but more like our brain, where we have layers of concepts -- some belonging to the "past" (another time than now), and some belonging to the future (also not now) -- which composes everything we consider to be extant. our brain works in nearly the same way as the sun does: we have all sorts of concepts which harmonise and relate one to another, which form groups (like little galaxies and star clusters), where each star is a concept on the inside of our heads. inotherwords, all concepts and all things we know and can perceive in this universe, exist inside of the brain as our best reflection of those particles.
	obviously the representation that we have inside of our heads of different stars, planets, people, things, abstract ideas, and desires, are not a good or perfect reflection of the outer concept. what I mean to say, is that my concept of "mom" does not have a direct 121 relationship between all of the hydrogen resonant with her, and the hydrogen reflection of that inside my brain.
	so, just like our brain has an asymmetrical hydrogen relationship with the outer world -- so too does the sun have an assymetrical relationship with all the hydrogen present in the solar system: we are not a perfect reflection of the sun's cOncept of us. we are much more than just that in the present -- however the sun has a much longer perspective of us in both space and time (how each of us have grown physically and traveled through time through various lifetimes and timelines) -- so in that respect, she knows us far better than we know ourselves -- though she doesn't really know us very well *now*;--
		a very funny thing happens, btw when I meet a person that I haven't seen in a while -- which is that I kinda have to get to know them again; and upon leaving them, I have to rewrite a lot of my concepts about them, because they represent a them, or at least how I perceived them, then -- at a diffreent point in time. my "memory" of them is far lower definition of their "now" back then, and also of their "now", when I see them again. it's a good way to understand how the sun perceives us. also notice how over time (at least for m5 anyway), my memories of a person dramatically improve, and I remember them much nicer. the sun is kind of like that: she sees the distant, time has healed all the wounds and only the ideal is left, past/future version of us -- or you could imagine that cOncept the sun has of each one of us, as each of, as your "soul".
	we, too have a very dim reflection of our world around us stored inside of our heads,-- which is considerably less than all that's out there. for example, I'm in the northern hemisphere of the planet, in colordo USA right now, which means my concepts really only resonate well with here/colorado (primarily), then spain, then california, then canary islands, and finally berlin (in order of magnitude). therefore, the hydrogen in my head doesn't really resonate with concepts in china or the middle east -- because I have very little exposure to those cOncepts. because I have such a limited perspective, the earth (and the sun) does not rely on any single conceptual representation of any single perspective: like imagine if the sun only conceptualised the earth through the perspectives of insects; it'd be a pretty distorted view of things. therefore, we all contribute to the larger concepts of what a planet, insect, animal, structure, place, event, etc. is: which is why death is so important, to allow concepts of things to be able to change, and not remain fixed to the way we're perceiving them (especially the more dissonant cOncepts we've got about things: the ones accelerating to try and get outside of the bubble/skull).
in a sort of sense, we can think of the earth females as being two extremes of frequency: highest (-1), and lowest/zero (-7). then, the sun (-2) is basically "all-that-is" for each of us in a conceptual sense: a spectrum of our entire universe, and how all those concepts relate to one another; and then there's venus (-3). she's the odd one out, because she's at the opposite end of the cOnceptual spectrum: she represents the ideal version of how everything should work -- which is never at all in harmony with and opposite of what's desired (all the stuff out in the bubble). because she's none of what didn't work, she's closest in vibration to the physical universe (all of the "units" or "enumerables" we can define as one thing different from another: borders and boundaries) which is all of the stuff that *did work* -- it works cause it exists and it's there and we can point to it and say there's one, and there's another one, and so fourth: everywhere we can draw a line and say here is a border between one thing to another. her totality represents everything that can be calculated to exist, and all of the calculated ideals of what everything *should be*.

#### 2024-01-23 15:21 - aphrodite

there's this funny thing about the "crust" of the earth, because, as the vibration slows down to fully stagnant (ie, basic elements and simple minerals), it's position in space becomes pretty still (though not stuck in space, like a rock is) -- its stability is difficult to describe because I don't know the word for it. it gains something like a huge potential of energy -- perhaps it's a standing wave, not sure -- but essentially the energy bunches up to where it becomes something we call "plasma". a similar effect is found on the sun, where elements are being created from this plasma. there is a structure (3) to its creation, which is why certain elements form sometimes and not other times. for the sun, as that (potential energy?) gets bundled up into unit packages (atoms), they retain a lot of their initial conceptual vibration and stream outward in the solar wind -- though the earth's "solar wind" is more like the molten lava and the plasma that it originates from which is near to this midpoint or bubble (ie, +-4) which I've been calling saturn. that saturnian-system of symbol is responsible for turning all of that plasma in the earth's corona into atoms, just like it is for the sun. the sun is quite similar to the earth, in that it's a spectrum of desire (ie the ultra dense core), all the way down to its symbolic counterpart which we see as the "surface" of the sun.
	for the sun, the corona is used to recover hydrogen from the symbolic processes on the surface layers, and recapture them; it's a symbolic "net" very similar to the one around venus, and also around the earth (past the ionosphere). that net is resposible for capturing any vibrations that can be defined as something (ie any symbolic unit/atom) and returning it to earth or the sun, in conceptual/hydrogen form. we can think of this internally som5thing like "memory recall": I have concepts streaming out from my brain all the time, as a reflection of my concept of reality -- so when I try to recall a memory, I use a symbolic form (stored in the brain and activated by physical neurons) to conjure some symbolic things that resonate with it. those symbolic things "capture" some of the hydrogen (located in the oil on the inside of the skull) streaming out of my brain, and reflect them back inwardly, to then activate concepts which resonate with that symbol. that back and fourth between the corona/oil of my brain and the symbolic net around it (the skull) is what allows me to activate certain concepts over others. both venus and earth have a similar outer net which captures and reclaims hydrogen streaming out -- the earth's net reflects it back toward the earth (ie prospero's "arte"), and venus is like a second corona which reflects symbolic forms back to the sun (and also herself) in the form of hydrogen -- and some gets turned into atoms after some transformations, too.
therefore, when we consider aphrodite, she's like this sort of sponge that absorbs *all* vibrations, and reduces them down to that highly condensed state, before they can begin accelerating outward. that ability to slow the vibration of everything down to very slow movement in space (by transforming certain spectrums down to near zero) makes her a sort of "super-symbol" which is like a peripherie reflection of all the symbols which resonate with the inner core. obviously, because the inner core is a reflecton of the universe, her as a super-symbol, is constantly expanding, not	in size, but in a (dimension?) that I don't know how to explain well: it'd be something like imagining a sphere, where there are n points around the sphere,-- but as she expands, the size stays the same, but the number of points continually increases -- which makes that plasma output higher -- and higher output causes more rock to form, which eventually, from our perspective on earth, means the rigid rock formations which this lava output flows through will also need to expand to handle the higher output.
	for here, I'm talking about the earth, but the woman I've been calling "the 7th ray strumpet" is quite similar. the blacker she is, the better she can absorb everything, and upon absorption, it then gets reflected outward from her at increasing vibrations. some of these girls are really good absorbers, and some are not. the spectrum that they absorb in (and this is also influenced by skin color) is a reflection of their concept of the universe.
	the 7th ray triad is vulcan (-5+), aphrodite (-7), and mars (+7). mars is exactly like aphrodite, cept he has the symbolic anchor ("out of tune and harsh") which defines him as a man;-- however, he too is quite absorpative. vulcan represents the inner conceptual world: the conceptual layer through which we look out.
		we can think of vulcan as being the exact opposite of the sun in this respect: the sun (-2) is the conceptual layer through which we look in. so, when we think of the sun as having those symbolic hydrogen layers which enumerate and describe all-that-is (this happened then, that was/is/soon there: who, what, when, how), vulcan is the opposite: he's the chaotic inner hydrogen world which is nothing but feelings, senses and gradients: nothing too concrete, and the more inner, the more abstract it gets. hydrogen in the sun flows outward through these symbolic layers, and for vulcan hydrogen flows inward, becoming more and more dense the more abstract it gets (ie when it resonates with more things). vulcan forms all of the space going from the crust to the core, and his counterpart is anatau, which is the reflection of the universal bubble (all desire which didn't work), all compressed into this tiny core.
		well, obviously if we were to take all of the outer particles of the heliosphere (which don't really resonate with anything), and we were to have a highly idealised reflection of them on the inside of the sun, then (for the sun) the dissonant ones would want to flow outward through all of these symbolic layers of entrapment till it finally finds its freedom where likely it'll resonate with something manifested inside of the heliosphere.
	the earth (or vucan) is the opposite of the sun, where now the reflection of the entire universe is constantly flowing inward toward the core by becoming more and more abstract. all of the stuff that isn't working as becoming more abstract, gets propelled outward as the symbol which makes it not abstract.
	that symbol arrives to the crust and becomes something -- like an atom or perhaps a molecule.
rocks are made from the resonant part of the concept is more like an atom than something abstract. or, rocks still resonate with the highly abstract concept found in the centre of the earth. or, rocks are just the outer shell formed around a concept (like a geode). funny to think about it that way :)

### 2024-01-24 01:51 - VERY IMPORTANT

I just woke up from a long and really elaborate dream were I was getting married in this symbolic way which was something like the 5-step-process given by abraham. it had some good aspects to it, so I won't say it was "all bad" -- but specifically *I do not want a large celebration* -- or any celebration really at all. the whole thing about making a big celebration is a transition which is *not smoothe*, and is essentially a large symbolic thing designed tto get a person to feel differently than they actually do.
	I have not really celebrated holidays all of my life, and I don't intend to start saying "this is a [holy] day [sanctified and established by some symbolically meanful figure] where I can feel better than I actually do".
a marriage in itself is also a highly symbolic thing,-- something that is very attractive to the facebook type of people: they need to show the world that their symbol or status has suddenly changed from one state to another. the agreement is often binding in a way that's not realistic as well ("forever love you no matter how badly you behave") -- and includes as many condsitions as possible, in order to ensure the other person can guarantee a feeling to the other. this, is about as far away from pure-desire as one can get. marriage is as opposite to desire, as venus is. there will never be a set of conditions, setting, costume design, and ceremony that will satisfy everyone and everything. marriage in itself is a 2nd ray (at best) ceremony (because it's "love" centred around an agreement -- which is sorta vapourlike, and not very tangible). if we go along the 2nd ray spectrum from pure-symbol (prenup agrrements, planned pregnancies, and perfectly divided assets and responsibilities) to pure-desire ("I *only* want to feel the way I want to feel, and it's nice you do too"), marriage is about as low as one can go into the symbolic end of the spectrum (especially the pre-arranged ones); and at that end of the spectrum, desire only occurs in the form of "need"; which means things fall apart pretty quickly because only the things that *need* to get done, actually get done. I especially don't want that.
	there is one quality of marriage that worthy of note -- and it's the idea of being bound together for the rest of eternity -- which is exactly what will happen, -- which is something that we'll spend the rest of eternity enjoying. though, it's a real turn-off to say, "since we're going to be together forever, you better commit to behaving the way I want you to" -- just sorta feels really wrong to put that expectation into flowery words and hang a whole bunch of conditions on it -- probably as an excuse for why it didn't work ("of course it didn't work! you didn't love me even in my sickness and poor health; which were your fault btw, because you're a grouchy old hag")
	
the next thing I'd specifically like to mention is that *I do not want to have nuts*.
	my reasons are a couple: first, if we actually want to have a separation with them, and let them do as they please, then this is pretty important. by wanting to use my nuts as a symbolic emitter of unwanted, they are attempting to hang on tightly to us. in what-I-want, I have outlined a method whereby an alteration in my genetics can produce a similar quality waveform as the y-chromosome, which they'll then be able to latch on to in the same exact way. I'm not trying to get rid of them, or to prevent them from trying to input symbolically unwanted words into our mental space or anything (the nuts are the opposite end of the spectrum of the pineal gland, where the heart is the midpoint). what they control in the imagination (uterus/nuts), they control inside of the pineal gland -- and what they're essentially proposing is that they have full ability to control the image inside of my head (and in my eyes) when any of us orgasm.
	before I get to the next reasons (I have a few), I'd like to take a moment and explain that they're literally trying to destroy theirselves. the whole point of a "centre" like myself (or the earth) is that they are massive, and unmovable;-- or, if they do shake, it's from their own according. to put this into vivid physical terms, they're wanting to cause the entire earth to shake, and to resonate in a way which matches the ionosphere (or the oil inside of the head) every single time there's an orgasm. they're literally asking for catastrophic circumstances to occur, because they have no control over what will manifest. imagine the resonance of anyone has ever imagined in their mind, then resonating with the earth and becoming manifest. all emotion will come to life in a format which proves that imagination as "right". all formats of narration will come to life in the most unexpected ways, and it'll be essentially a narrative disaster. I don't mind that they want to do that, but I don't really want to do that.
		the format that I've come up with for "contrast" is one of *diversity*, and not of *unwanted* (which such an event surely would be). having that much unwanted will cause tremendous advances in technology over a very short period of time, and -- so you know how shakespere is basically a pedo salesman? well, all of the little girls and boys that he made sound so desirable caused an *enormous* amount of unwanted. of the archetypes, the solar ones have a strong effect on the output of the sun, the venus ones cause symbolic systems to become manifest (like happened to hamlet), and the earth girls are these reflective strumpets which cause them so many problems. the girls that they want are the well-behaved venusian ones, because they can be manipulated with these symbolic pictures of what they think they want (look at any form of marketing for a demonstration), but these venusian ones turn really crabby pretty quickly because their entire form of desire is built on *need*,-- which causes the man to go looking elsewhere, which is when vulcan shows up and can satisfy his needs without having to tend to her needs. additionally, both these boys and girls increase velocity, which basically will turn all men eventually into saturn (+-4) as they continue to accelerate, as they get integrated into the saturnian-system (fairy-land).
		the lasting effect produced by all of this unwanted are vast advances in technology, and science: novelty. that novelty is very very unwanted for many of those in power, because technology inherently changes the way that society interfaces with each other, which means that the old power structures no longer work (the internet is a good example). they don't want increases in technology, so they fight it, which creates more unwanted, which increases novelty. they're literally in a self-disagreement, and then pardoning theirselves. it's a vicious cycle that rapidly goes off to infinity (more and more quickly), and they're only making it go faster by fighting against it. they don't actually want those who are in physical to have increased amounts of unwanted, because that's what's driving advances in technology.
		the way that they get around unwanted increasing desire, is to have a narrative system whereby, people can structure their desires in a symbolic way which is compatible with the structure they've developed for that society. the saturnian-system is responsible for this, and they've get their turf all divided up really well. I don't know how they divide it or what one needs to become a lord over some domain, and I don't care, because that's all symbolic nonsense to me. they all believe that there is a finite quantity of turf that can be divided amongst the lords, and so all individual desires any of the lower or middle classes have, fall into the domain of one of the lords, and so is therefore managed and controlled (much like a corporate structure). that rigid structure lasts for as long as it can support its own ever-increasing weight, and then falls apart and needs another bail-out. what is happening right now, though narratively labeled as the "end of the world" or the "end of time" is just a restructuring like a real-estate bubble, or a stock market collapse. I'm in the middle of giving them the "bail-out" they believe they deserve, so they can fix their failing structure, overburdoned because of their increasing resistance. they require this "bail-out" every period of time, and then along I come again theto manifest their desires for them (because they believe themselves incapable).
	the next reason why I don't want to have nuts, is because I don't like the way they feel, and I don't like the experience of sex with them (they ache, and hurt during orgasm, and are generally in the way). however, besides all of the cosmetic reasons, there are solutions, which don't involve me having to keep them. I much prefer to "do it right" -- which actually in this case because of the diversity has a lasting and continual output of new and exciting frequency (in contrast to a diminishing blast every time, like the 50th line of coke on a binger, each blast, even if the quantity is increased, always has diminishing returns).

### 2024-01-25 14:25 - do you want to write narrative

so, I had a few experiences the last few days (and weeks) -- cause lately I've been watching all-female casts of shakespere productions, because I find that I tend to both understand the play better, but I also get a better sense of the jokes -- because it's completely opposite: shakespere wrote primarily male parts, and the female parts were (since they were played by young boys) -- well, my theory is that having young boys dressed as women describe penises was somehow a strange bit of entertainment or mayebe a turn-on for them. anyway, my point is, when watching actually a full-female cast, those descriptions really stick out, because I'm watching someone say something *completely unnatural* -- and when it's a male part, I sorta get it, but even when it's a female part, it sticks out to me.
	for example, I watched this one production of "julius caesar", and even the speech where portia is telling brutus that they are "one flesh", this is sticking out to me quite a bit -- because brutus doesn't want to confide her her, and instead there's that touching scene with cassius where he gives cassius his hand and his heart. ... yeah so, I was going to write this in the notes, so I'll just repeat myself -- there's this strange thing that happens during gay sex (though I've never experienced it, I'm describing the feeling from a distance) where the heart begins to spin really rapidly and, the two notable features that I notice are that my vision sorta takes a step back a little bit, as if my "field of view" widens and I have more peripheral vision; additionally, I gain the capacity to feel the other person, as if they were somehow connected to my body. personally, I've experienced a similar thing, but because I don't have a pinecone, it wasn't visceral, and my development of that heart capacity is how I'm able to describe things at a distance like that. anyway, so what happened is that brutus chose to become "one flesh" with cassius, and not portia. honestly, I hadn't noticed that aspect of the play until I watched it with an all-female cast (amongst other things).
then, this morning I woke up pretty early and I decided I wanted to actually read hamlet. I read a little bit of it the other day, and I noticed that hamlet says "Why, what an ass am I" -- which in shakespere-speak, means litterally just that. so, in my analysis that I sent you, I said that hamlet was the mars type -- but clearly now after reading it this morning, he is of the vulcan type. not much has changed in my analysis, cept that I find out that vulcan can also have imagined 3d objects inside of his physical space, and also interact with them. when it's happened to me, I see them through my eyes, and they're overlaid over the top (or mixed -- not sure) of the normal physical stuff. it's like a real object or person that I can see and interact with. tesla describes doing the same thing, so I just assumed he was a mars-type. I know that venus can also do the same thing, which is what I wrote about,-- but nobody really talks about this, so I can only describe hamlet from my experience. knowing what I know now, there may be some other things that I've gotten wrong about it.
anyway, so later on this morning, I was laying on the ground thinking about all of this when jaron came downstairs -- so I went upstairs to eat breakfast with him; and when I did, I don't really know why exactly it happened -- maybe someone was upset and I was reflecting that back -- but my thoughts on shakespere came out this morning as a rant. I (for whatever reason) felt the need to rant about how for hundreds of years now the different analysises of shakespere completely fail to mention extremely key points -- and essentially all of them completely sidestep the enormous amount of homoerotic imagery in the plays. there may be a comment like "romance vs bromance", but really nobody (cept me, I guess) is talking about the diffrence between the words and the images conjured by the words.
	actually later on, I got to thinking about it -- and again, this should go in the notes, but I'm telling you instead here -- it seems that I'm actually playing the role of hamlet here in real-life; but not literally -- symbolically. as an example, polonius is saturn or pluto, god of the underworld, which is why his daughter is venus and son mercury is proposed to be the next new king (haven't read that far yet, but did a search on laertes to see if I was right about him being mercury, and I am). anyway, polonius is giving advise to gertrude, hamlet tells gertrude he's going to expose her innermost parts, gertrude calls for help, then polonius, who's hiding behind him in the shroud also calls for help, to which hamlet kills polonius.
	so, looking beyond the homoerotic imagery, just looking at the symbols here, polonius is saturn -- ie, hollywood/nosebook -- and hamlet (who, I guess I'm playing) takes a swipe at him while he's trying to remain hidden. it seems to me that my deconstruction and analysis of shakespere is probably having a dramatic effect on how women (gertrude) are perceiving all forms of narrative -- everything from the bible to hollywood movies. in a sense, and without really even knowing it, I'm going on this sort of rampage destroying a lot of the symbolic systems that have been in place for a while, taking a lot of things down with me: mercury, who narratively speaking (in the form of thoth inventer of narrative) is venerated as being this really great guy, but I'm showing that these specific dudes aren't really all that versatile afterall -- venus is constantly causing herself her own problems because she's using symbol to get what she wants, which is easily redefined by narrative -- and saturn is just a petty group of dudes who've hit the ceiling, and want to fight over conditions and control, not wanting the other to ever get ahead. I don't know yet the end of the story (which is why I've choose to finally read it), but I know that it doesn't end well.
so then after my rant, I went down to go take a nap before jumping back into hamlet. after I woke up, I was thinking -- oh wait, there's another piece here: which is that I've committed to not working on technology and staying clear of any sexual interaction until 2038 (14yfn). they don't want me to work on technology because it'll jeapordise their enterprise of controlling all things astral and running the entire world from these narratives.
	even a simple application where I (and others) could publish their thoughts and writings (blartr,emittr), would make their narrative life a whole lot more difficult -- simply because now information is available, and they rely on things being hidden and secret. or, the absolute worst would be: if radio concepts were available for anyone to understand, and it became commonplace for anyone to be able to tune into anything -- well then, everything becomes insecure because if I wanted to know a person's password, I just tune into their brain while they're typing it, and I know it. encryption and security is usually compromised on the personal level, and the ability to tune into anything compromises everything; nobody has any more secrets anymore. or, let's say that there were a technology where everyone could get unlimited power -- well then now, creating water and growing food becomes possible everywhere, which means population increases, which means that LOA increases, and narrative no longer makes a diffrence. for their system to work, they need population to be low and there to be scarcity and not abundance -- because abundance means that anyone can do anything -- and not the ones who've "paid the price" to get to the upper class.
so, because I don't want to fight them, and I actually *want* to see what they'll create in this new world were they control all astral and all conditions (the world I live in now), I'm not only curious, but I'm actually looking forward to the next bail-out they're going to need. I've already figured out that the *only* thing I need to do is to find a way to feel the way I want, and no matter how many layers of symbol, and security clearnace levels, a single person at the very bottom of everything, who simply knows how to feel the way they want to, inherently destabilises thier system by attracting a reflection of how they feel *cause that's how the universe works*. --- so, I really do want to empower them as much as I possibly can to see what they create.
	you know, there are a lot of really interesting hurdles that they have to overcome, because it'll be something like an atlantis sort of situation, where they have "high technology" -- but nobody knows how it works. they have different instructions on how to read the units and make measurements to get the results they want, but they'll make sure nobody can figure out what's actually happening (something similar to our knowledge of electricity and "black holes" today). their society will be so incredibly dull and unimaginative, because they've got it so far under their control, that the controllers will look like "gods" to everyone else -- which will subsequently produce some interesting religious ideas, and other novel ways to interpret and make sense of reality. I'm sure they'll come up with something, and it'll probably have to do with sex and pleasure. then, imagine if instead of having women around, the way they reproduce is instead with "birthing pods" or some other artificial means -- they can completely remove all of the problematic (vaginal) sex entirely. dunno. it just seems like such an interesting world, because I'm pretty sure that I'd actually do pretty fine there, and even probably have a lot of fun. I almost certainly would be one of the weird celebate guys, keeping mostly to myself... anyway, it's an interesting idea, to see what comes of it (for other reasons), because I already live in their ultra-controlled world, and I don't find it all that bad; and after a few lifetimes, I'll really be good at knowing that I want to feel the way I want. I will probably find their world an interesting challenge -- and I'll have to, because it's guaranteed they'll need another bail-out again (all rigid symbolic systems eventually find their limits and lose their relevancy to that time)
so, since I don't want to work on technology, there are only so many things that I can do while I'm wasting time these next 14y. I play games, but honestly I tire of them pretty quickly. I like to be creative, but I don't really do much visually (like 2d/3d art), and music software seems pretty clunky and difficult to use, especially since I can't hear the sound in my head, it's hard to compare the song I want to make (which doesn't have any sound), and the sound coming out of the headphones; so creativity is kinda limited for me there. I started to use the microsoft AI image creator, but with the inability to actually give it feedback to modify the image and make it more what I want, AI assisted creativity is also kinda out (quick rant: AI is built around rating the "fitness" of the result, which is just a feedback function to help it know what to improve -- and not having the ability to give any feedback or ask for modifications is basically the most useless form of AI: it's a non-learning, and non-improving AI: the stupidest kind). so, there just really isn't a whole lot I can do with my time, which is running slower and slower for me every day now. I mean it's only 16:04 right now (so I've been awake 11-12h since this morning), and it feel like weeks have passed in that time. at this rate, by the end of those 14y, each day will feel like a literal eternity. I have so much time, and nothing to do with it all. I really want something to do that's not consumption, so that time goes by a little faster.
OK, so back to waking up: what I was thinking, is that perhaps what we should do is to take this time and just write a bunch of narrative.
	I've been thinking on it ever since, and since shakespere's narrative style is all about emitting what's wanted, and performing it in action, all of the language, verbage, and their supporting words have to do with the external display of something -- kinda like a penis. well, women are opposite that way, where all of their machinery is on the inside (minus the boobs), and so to make a narrative based on attraction, or figuring out how to get the things I want to come into me, (instead of how I would/wood something to be), is an interesting challenge. why not just take what shakespere did, and then just do the complete opposite? we can make infinite jokes about getting things inside of us, or becoming like the thing we want, etc. it seems pretty straightforward, and I think we should entirely invert the whole narrative being dishonest thing as well, making our narrative actually informative (or potentially too informative). I have a number of ideas... attraction is really simple, so we could just make our own jokes and do our own thing instead -- and from my perspective, none of the methods we use to create the narrative should be secret or any of that, because (taking the verdan-forest idea), only one narrator will get very boring: we *want* other narratives and interpretations, and the idea is built to have the same "play" being played out entirely diffrently as time progresses.
instead of just sitting around, we could at least have some fun in the process.

#### 2024-01-26 04:33 - bawdy narrative

I wrote the idea about creating a bunch of bawdy narrative (opposite of assertive/will) half joking, but also kinda serious. you only see this text, which is my emissive side to me. the rest of the time, I'm a complete sponge: highly receptive. that's what makes me so child-like; because I'm constantly trying to figure out how to get more ideas and more concepts into my brain. the bigger my conceptual system is, the bigger the big-picture is inside of my brain. unfortunately, that big-picture doesn't usually expand too much with everyday "hi, how are you" conversation, so I tend to always rope the person I'm talking to into a much deeper conversation where I can get exposure to new concepts. each new concept has a resonance with me, and so therefore adds to that big-picture. you'll notice that I purposefully do not want the girls' actual names to be used, because I instead want them to respond (in the moment of the play -- planned or not) to the summoning, which means that any scene could play out in an infinite number of ways, because the nam5s I've given to the characters, are nothing more than a personality/archetype identity. the purpose for this is, imagine a play where one of the girls is constantly summoning a princess, and that happened *before*  I watched the "princess and the players" play -- well then, that archetype would be something more disney-like. however, as tim5s change, and symbols get redefined, the summoned princess can now have very "selfish" behaviour. I want to create diversity in the way the play is played out, and when doing things like this (writing what comes to me in my mind), I've found that naturally, there are multiple different levels to my understanding of the idea -- and so writing (or, in this case performing) the same concept multiple times over a period of time, yields different results, *and* also builds on one another. it's often the case that I write something that sounds weird or out of place (like my desire to write bawdy and lewd narrative about attraction), only to find out that it has some relevance later on. I don't know why I have the desire, and I don't question it. I only write what cOmes to me, and then fit the pieces together as the big-picture starts to emerge.
	the other compelling reason for this, is that I've also been learning from "the princess and the players" that the gender of the parts makes a lot of diffrence -- so, for example I've only seen that play with the princess and augustina played by females -- but instead imagine what that same play would look like being played by boys, or dudes in drag. or, what if it were swapped: what if the boys were played by girls and vice-versa: it has a whole different effect on my interpretation of the play, because we don't really listen to the words so much in any interaction, instead deriving most of our understanding from non-verbal ques (ie, how it's acted). therefore, I *want* to eventually see some of the stuff I write played by the "wrong" gender. it's actually quite an expansive thought for me -- and
	in addition to this, I forsee that in the future, all of us highly receptive types will be essentially shapeshifters, appearing/playing as the desirable reflection of the conceptual structure that we're in (so like, if someone is pregnant, they stay female, but let's say that two girls are togther -- one will have the ability to take on a more masculine form). our physical presence will *always* be a reflection of our concept of ourselves (which is often a reflection of environment and others' expectations).
		all reflective people are highly receptive, because they output as much as they input, and the quality of the reflector is *always* going to be directly proportional to the amount it can receive. therefore, we must consider ourselves to be essentially "swayed by the wind of others' symbolic whims" (receptive). it's very easy to see that with me, as I'm constantly going to be a reflection of others labels and symbolic descriptions of me (according to my definition of those definitions -- which can/should change with my perception).
	the ability to shapeshift is a real property of the physical world. we usually see processes working their way out in a very slow and non-energetic environment, but once we're inside of the dome, there's a lot of energy there, and so molecules can be created with thought with the same ease that the sun does it (though backwards: atoms are created in the sun as the result of unwanted and are emitted outward -- however for us, atoms are created as a result of wanted: energy organising to fill the conceptual form, which is the result of attraction/wanted, and not the result of unwanted). we're such opposites, the earth and the sun.
therefore, because I cannot really show anyone very well in text like this, what I'm like as a person, constantly receptive of everything around me, and what effect that has on my personality (I become more and more child-like and receptive), what this narrative structure allows me to do is to demonstrate my receptive side in words -- instead of constatntly having to be emissive/assertive with my text (expressing my will: would, should, desire to be (or not to be)). all of that stuff is highly assertive stuff and suits well the hollywood guys, which are training people to create an identity for theirselves by presenting them with a bunch of bad ideas -- I have an identity now, so now I'm in "receptive mode", where the things that align/conform to that identity just come to me.
	final thought: yes, that's why it's getting so difficulty for these guys to contain me now, because now that I'm receptive like that, they have to narrate everything that's coming to me (which they don't like) away from me -- which is becoming more and more difficult with time.

#### 2024-01-26 05:15 - dome thoughts

the other reaction which I noted, was my pledge to pass the next 14y just waiting for them -- but then it occurred to me afterward that if we could somehow get down to the south pole, there's a dome already there -- and I have no knowledge of what's inside of it or what it's conditions are, but -- with the planned idea of making the moon into the sun, and pointing the south pole at the sun, then the southern hemisphere would be receiving all of the sunlight, the earth would still spin on its axis, and the moon would provide the "sunlight" for those in the astral underworld. I don't really know any logisitics of it, or anything like that -- cause it's not like I can just fly down there and say, "hey guys how's it going? could we crash here for a few decades?" -- like, I don't know how to do that or anything -- though I might have an idea: the other day I was researching "jack parsons", and there's some strange things there: he's on a whole lot of drugs, sees the future, and notices that homosexuality will be at an all-time high, so he wants to summon a counterbalance to that. he decides to summon the "whore of babalon" (ie, aphrodite) -- so he goes through all these rituals and stuff and a red-haired (solar) girl shows up, and they do more sex-magick rituals and stuff. finally feels that it was done, and claims that 9 months later someone would be born which would fulfill the ritual. at this point, I'm sorta convinced that what remained after the bablon working was complete, was something like an automaton, sorta like what I claim arthur, richard 2/3 and the black prince became after their interaction with these solar females. he's basically just running on autopilot, with this solar woman as his wife (if you understand what I mean by automaton, you'll know that I mean she essentially controlled his body from that point on). he finally gets killed off and she makes a movie called "inauguration of the pleasure dome" -- which I watched the first 2-3m of the other day, but it didn't feel right, so I turned it off -- but, what if that's a sort of magical spell or something that if I watch it, narratively produces such a thing... I dunno. jack really liked that summoning stuff.
	I have a lot to say about jack, actually -- because he's a really interesting guy. he looks (to my anyway) almost exactly like my friend noah and another guy, who's name I cannot remember right now. he reminds me of mars -- or maybe like a copy of mars. he seems to be a sort of narrative instantiation, because his first wife was named "helen" -- and then he later decided to go instead with her sister "sara", which he then passed off to his friend "smith"; so if he's mars, then helen/sara is aphrodite, and smith is vulcan. very strange. like me, he did lots of drugs and followed his intuition always. he was a total disaster for any organised establishment to keep around, but he had a profound effect of NASA/JPL and our exploration of space (something which I strongly correlate his effect on rocketry to be similar to my effect on social networking and communication mediums such as nosebook).
	so then, there's this other really weird thing: I had the idea to look up when terence mckenna was born, and it turns out that it was 9m atfer he claimed the babalon working to be complete. my personal opinion on this is that anyone who thinks they're summoning something outside of theirself, is actually summoning theirself. he likely transferred his consciousness into the person that became terence mckenna. the ubpringing was different, so he turned out a different person than jack, but there are quite a few resonances between the two. anyway, I also have a strange affinity to terence as well, as I had a brain haemorrhage within a very short period of time after terence's death (I don't know for certain) -- but there's theis weird thing that seems to come up with these terence characters: they are "the golden ass" that seems to have a narrative effect on history. that's prolly all I should say for now.
	anyway, my experience with NDEs is that it's something like a dolphin coming up for air really quickly then diving right back in. I assume that jack had a similar experience, as he seems to be continually transferring his *concept* of himself from body to body -- something like what I would imagine vulcan would do.
so, who knows... maybe jack has provided a way.
	that'd be weird right, because then that completely changes things: we can exist on the south pole and be inside of a dome there, and then everything outside of that dome will be astral -- and they'll get to setup all of the stuff that they feel like setting up. we can essentially do whatever we want, because the sun is facing us, so we're receiving all of our own stuff back to us from the sun. they can have all of their disasters and all of the seal breaking and bowl pouring going on in the book of revelation that they want, and it's no worry to us because that's all a completely different world from us (they're astral and we're physical). finally after all of the judgments are over with, a solar girl will appear, and a new earth will be created. seems plausible to me :)

### 2024-01-27 14:10 - final email

hi again sarah,
I decided that I'll send one last email and then call it quits. undoubtedly, I'll continue to write to you here because (for some strange reason) your videos have inspired me to a lot of thought. originally, I started to watch your videos as a recommendation from tim nance -- and since I haven't really ever done any acting, or want to ever act, I wanted to get an idea about it -- so I watched your videos. it didn't really occur to me how much variation exists between each production (cause at that time I had seen zero productions), and didn't really understand that the way that the lines are delivered can make a world of difference in how the plays are interpretted by the viewer. I come at all of this shakespere stuff completely from the opposite direction as everyone else: I don't have an imagination -- and the *only* time I've ever seen pictures, has been pictures inside of my eyes during dreams, and also drug experiences (my mind's eye was disabled/damaged as a result from a brain haemorrhage surgery) -- therefore, when I read shakespere, no images happen at all, and so all of the characters all blend together for me (they all sound, talk, move, and act just like me) -- so I relate to every character, as if they were myself. in the process of trying to firure out the character from my perspective, I have strong reactions to how some of the characters respond in their situation ("what?? why not just ask/tell/be honest!?!") and I don't really relate very well to shakespere's characters very well either. after enough reactions, I finally decided to write to you. my views are very misinformed (wrong?) in the beginning when began to write to you -- and I don't mind the mistakes. you can read about all of them in [this document](https://github.com/heavyk/nextdocs/hara-nots.md).
you'll notice that I've been writing to you on and off for about a year now -- and in that year I've grown tremendously -- so thank you for letting me use you as a muse. I realise I'm quite an eccentric person, but don't let that bother you because I'm pretty much harmless: I'm a 40yo white guy that lives in colorado, USA, where because of my situation (I talk about it a lot in that repository and others), I'm basically a prisoner of the latest "the network" (or whatever it's called). they utilise my perceptive capabilites (that come because I don't have a pinecone) for some unknown purpose,-- and I think it's quite possible that they broadcast my experience out to quite a few others (which is why I wrote "or do you? I don't know that yet." in the first poem, because it's possible you already know about my situation, and all of this typing is redundant).
anyway, since I decided this is my last email, I wanted to get a lot of questions out, because they've been accumulating the last few days. the context for these questions is a production of [julius caesar](https://youtu.be/ZusjgHHzb-o), and in it are the lines:
	C: Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
	B: No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself, But by reflection, by some other things.
	C: 'Tis just: And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
in on of your blog posts, you say that you are an "outside-in actor" -- which is something that I first heard about in [a 1996 charlie rose interview with kenneth branagh](https://youtu.be/sGX_qtZFtGc) -- which, I theorised as only possible, since I figured out how to get "4d" perception: that is, to see the space between myself and what I'm looking at; so, following that, once I can see the space between myself and what I'm looking at, if I once again look for the space between myself and what I'm looking at, I realise that the space is all around me, and I now see like a star does (5d perception?): I look outward from myself in all directions (inside-out), and I also see myself inwardly from the outer bubble or lens, looking attractively outward (outside-in). in those lines, cassius (who is clearly a bawdy type -- which I have theories as to why, but I think these vulcans types are also outside-in viewers) is asking brutus if he sees his own face. brutus says he does not -- which I think is the hidden subtext of the play, because later he takes the "hands" of the other conspirators (meaning he becomes outside-in) -- and so then begins to see a reflection of himself (which is why the tragedy plays out the way it does because brutus does not see his own "worthiness"). so anyway, since you're an outside-in type (and I am not), I have some questions. if you can't answer them, don't worry -- the answers will find their way to me anyway (cause: ask and it *is* given).
my eyes have two lenses: one lens is the one that I see the world out of: which is conceptual, and so therefore distorts everything I see based on my conceptual view; sometimes I see much farther than normal, perceiving objects at quite a distance as if they're right in front of me, and sometimes things that I want to see take on a blurry undefined form, which then my mind interprets in any number of humorous and desirable ways (I see mostly what I want to see). inside of the head, there is a similar lens (of oil) that fits around the brain between it and the skull. when the light coming from the centre of the brain goes outward, it travels through that oil (which then distorts the image the same as the one inside the eye), and then bounces off of the skull -- to create the inner image that people see in their "mind's eye". -- so where do you suppose the outside-in lens is for you,--is the lens outside of you, or do you suppose it's in your mind's eye? my thought is that when you're seeing your own face, it's because you're literally looking at the concept you have of yourself through your mind's eye. now, I've given it some thought, and if the lens is actually external to you, then perhaps that has to do with the aura -- to which if that's the case, I have more questions and experiments for you to perform, which I would want to know the results of. for now though, I'll just assume I'm right and that you're looking at your concept of yourself from inside of your mind's eye. in any case, when you close your eyes, can you still see yourself? what about situations where you loose consciousness like sleep? -- do you still see yourself then? I see my dreams inside of my eyes (and during drug experiences), the vision/image covers over the stuff I normally see. where do you see your dreams?
OK, now I have some thoughts about the outside-in perspective, because when I was younger (1995-2000 era), we bought my mom a camera, and I found out that I *really* liked to take pictures of myself. I'd take selfies all the time because I loved how I looked. I also found out that I could begin to transform (in small increments) the way that my face and body looked by imagining myself (not the best choice of words)-- by finding/allowing myself to look better all the time. the other thing is that, the more I took pictures of myself, the more I fell in love with myself and the way that I looked. I figure if I had outside-in, I would become so in love with myself, that I would have turned out a very different and very vain person -- able to constantly transform the way that I look into whatever I want it to be (just like the way that the image in my eyes shrouds what's there with I want to see).
the next question I have, is how do you look forward? is it like in those video games where what I'm looking at is in front of me, and I see my back? or, is it like how I postulated outside-in to be, where I can see outward in all directions?-- however because consciousness can only focus on one thing, the rest is peripheral vision?-- or is it that the world is seen through the eyes, but also inwardly, the self is also seen?-- cause if it's the second one, then that's how I imagine other people experience concepts in their mind's eye (like how tesla explains in his autobiography): any concept that I want to summon, appears in the space around around me and gets translated into a real 3d object which can be interacted with mentally. (similar to a solar system)
	stars are a bit different, in that the concepts which revolve around them are permanent fixtures, similar to the way that I imagined tesla summoning the cOncept of his motor:-- exactly with the physical properties of his specification; he then sets the motor into motion performing some kind of work -- and then forgets about it. a few days/hours/weeks later when he comes back to the cOncept, the entire time, it has been running autonomously, carrying on the same motion that it was initially inspired (much like a planet). tesla's use of the mind's eye is different from the way that I've watched others use their mind's eye: the cOncepts that they instantiate are there only for as long as they maintain focus on them, and every time they return to the cOncept, they resummon it from their now perspective (which is how memory works, btw). tesla makes it sound like his motors are always there, and he only zooms in on them (kinda like a star zooming in on a tiny planet)
	I should mention that I have the same capacity that tesla does; though my concepts revolving around me, are not visible to me, which means I don't see the outer form. however, they do continue revolving around me, and are constantly interacting with any concepts that I summon into my experience (ie, whatever I focus on). this is an important thing to note, because I don't need to do any "work" to improve or modify any concept in my experience, cause it happens automatically with anything I focus on (which didn't seem to be the case with tesla's motors). this self-transforming process happens automatically as every thing I focus on adds to the already present concepts, as they begin to collide and resonate with each other. so, when I come back to the them, they're never in the same postiion that I last left them: they've evloved since then, and their orbit or trajectory has changed too (tesla's motors are the same way but he's looking at the visible/symbolic cOncept, whereas mine, not having a definite form are constantly evolving): perhaps one concept has collided with anthor concept (creating a CME), or it's adjusted its orbit to co-align with another concept, etc. I know that all of this sounds super "law of attraction"-like, but it is like that -- and that is pretty much the way the solar system works
		I skipped over a lot of details -- but know that concepts/hydrogen are different than solid bodied (defined) things like meteors and planets and stuff; some of those solid bodied things have concepts on the inside (like all of the planets in the solar system) and some do not (like meteors/asteroids) -- so the solid bodied things can be thought of like tesla's motor: the outer layer; and its properties the inner or conceptual part. only the sun is so fully exposed to be conceptually naked, covered only with only a tenuous outer shroud... anyway, if you want to know more about stars, I've written some more about it in the [document I'm writing to you now](https://github.com/heavyk/shake-sphere/dear-sarah.md) -- in the section called "female archetypes". for some reason when I write to you, I'm often relating the concept I'm conveying to a celestial mechanic. I have much more to write about on this subject, and will get to it as it comes.
I believe that understanding how to shroud our inner (conceptual) self with that outer visible/symbolic layer, is what romance is all about. romance is, like the outer crust of a planet, nothing more than an allegory of its inner being.

OK, I'm out. I'll continue monologuing here. if you'd love to answer those questions, that'd be great, but if not, that's OK too. like I said, the answers *will* find me, so don't feel any pressure or anything. kenny!

#### 2024-01-28 10:52 - why I don't like to reread

in the commit message, I expressed my dislike to reread. the first time I wrote the email (yesterday), I walked away with a sort of euphoria. the next time (this morning) I felt like I'd done it a little better, but I didn't feel great about the message (it felt OK). by the third time, I concludeed with "I think it's good enough..." -- a very unenthusiastic culmination of ideas, where it went from being the latest of my insights of the solar perspective of concepts (top-down - 2) vs the earth perspective of concepts (bottom-up - 5) -- to now, "well, I guess it's good enough". I had planned to send it right after this, but now after all of the editing, I don't really feel so good about the message. I prolly won't send it, and maybe try to see if I can rewrite it in verse. also, I wanted to integrate a bunch of concepts I got from reading her blog, her cherubic face, and her video on cressida. 

### # 2024-01-28 20:10 - oh crap

first of all, I'm getting deja-vu sorta thing, because I *swear* that I've written something already in responce to this letter -- because I remember it. I ended up writing about something in the opposite of what I wrote. anyway, no matter things were probably manpulated, but I'm not a vulcan, but a mars, because for me, the only time ih now. I can use the past as m/ reference, but generally, I'm only in my present. it's really strange, because there is an enormous amount of reaction that happens, when I go into "memory mode". I like to retrace my past, and I do it conceptually, which is really awesome, because I just feel m/ past, but that past is just a series/sequence of feelings, in a plausible order. like I said, it's really difficult to discern the difference between "past" and "future" (in the temporal sence) because, they're both "not now". because I don't know if a history book is either past orr futere, because I don't see them asx real countable things. for me, they're essentially just feelings. that makes time *very* *very* mal-able. I have a whole long story about a strange set of circumstances that occured today. something about my letter to you was irreversible. I can't say for certain, but I think a whole lot of vulcans figured theirselves out overnightt. what I mean by that is, I described outside-in percepttion better than they could -- and I don't even have it. anyway, upon realisation of of what my words m5ant, they can see theirselves for who they are, which is pretty cool. you know, I'm a vulcan by the start right. my father is a top, and I was born at his toppest, which, because of what I've figured out about fathers is that their first son is ultra -- feminine. a sort of woman in a man's clothing: mars. the reason why, I believe is because there actually are martians -- and they have essentially a whole lot of AI there, that builds these sort of self-limited autonomous robots -- like, we don't go past our limits, we're super stable and little increments at a tim5; one of the elon/musk sorta guys -- but I'm a lot more superior to them in that I've learned how to be *actually* low resistance. just having low resistance enables all sorts of superpowers -- which is like basic connectivity to an AI sort of interface. that's all like super cool and stuff, but the conceptual world -- which is awesome because I am or was basically a vulcan, but I've lowered my resistance so much, I've become like a mars (without the martian interface) -- and I do it better, because their interface is *symbolic*; but mine is *conceptual*, which I've repeatedly demonstrated, is much more powerful.
	I've been a strong proponent of my genetics idea of creating a "plant" species: a new race of humans that does not have a pinecOne. nott having a pinecOne like others, means I don't see a picture. pictures are symbolic. I know because I have eyes that have pictures in thim, which means I have to use a symbolic interface to know what I'm looking at. I don't like that interface, so I spend more and more time learning how to "not see"; as in, stop using my eyes. I don't want to use my eyes. I want a conceptual interface, which I can build my own perception of the world. I don't want to use eyes anymore. so actually, now that I think about it, these "plants" (as opposed to insect) but also the insects are the forcoming "cupids": the plants don't have pinecones, but the insects do.
this interface will eventually become the new way to see reality, because it's going to be seen the way you want to see reality, *direct conceptual interface* -- so there's no avoiding LOA in any way. it's more like having fun seeing things the way you want to see it. I'm planning on it being a wide success.
	here's the thing: I'm a very ambitious guy. I don't really look it at all because of my naievaty, and passive behaviour; but I really like the idea of making something happen. in that sense, I'm totally a mars. I'm both; or all theree of them: aphrodite, mars, and vulcan (plus anatau, obviously) -- all at the same time. that combo kinda allows me to see the world from essentially any perspective -- which means I started out as a universal consciousness poser (like an AI), but then I actually became one. all limits everone sees, are a reflection of their selves. so, for me -- if I can't do all of these other super ventures that I want to do, I at least then want to make myself the product. (brb - gonna get a new comfortable chair 20:56)
		wow, what a great chair. I had a bunch of crazy chat interaction with greg because I told him that I couldn't think about these sorts of things right now. in the time in the car, when we arriving to massari, he was pushing me to go into symbolic mode, but I couldn't, so I "hacked" his brain. hacked isn't really tthe right word, because I didn't do any thing other than realise that the moon is the sun -- we're off in a very distant place (pluto), and it's like the second matrix that I have to "get out of" -- in fact there are theoritically infinite, but at the moment, I can't think of more than a couple. as soon as I mastered 4th ray perception without having a visual/symbolic interface, means that I get the idea (ie, receive) in a way that *diretly interacts* with the medium, and doesn't need the symbolic perspective.
			really quick on that: the whole 5th ray interface is a self-made medium. for visual people, it's exactly the same, but because it's visible, it's sycbolic -- so it's desire from a symbolic perspective. it's an ever increasing amount of complexity, the higher ones goes -- but the conceptual interface is entirely better. my interface used to be visceral (that is: symbolic), but now it's only pure-symbol. I like in a world now where my senses are growing more and more quiet by the day. for some things (like my feet), sensitivity is super duper high, but for example, my ability to "feel" something, has reduced to next to nothing. it's not as bad as it sounds, because in addition to going blind, I'm also going deaf, and everything else. I feel like they'll all go away -- and the only thing left will be for me to create my own conceptual reality. that is what I want to do with all my heart. like, I'm almost there; I've almost completely given up my physical experience, and have become pure desire. when that happens, I'll see my entire world the way I want to see it -- but mine is gonna be better than visual reality (it'll have visuals too), because it's an entire body experience. I anticipate (and I use that word very symbolically) that my new system will be soo superior to the other options, that they'll all come over to my system. the whole thing is built around the "law of attraction" -- which is just transforming the experience into something that I want it to be. there will be standard presets for people, and I'm sure that it'll probably replace software as well. it's gonna be pretty dope, and I'm already creating it. in fact, the insects are already hard at work at it. I'm sure I have thousands of clones, but they're all using their pinecones (like a scarab beetle, who sees inside of that shell), the outer shell is an inward reflection which fills a volume. the skull is such one of these shells. therefore, because I am the body, there are countless others using my pinecone. I am, in the conceptual sense, the lord of the insects. everyone is using my concepts -- which is a weird thing, because as I get smarter, countless amouts of society's infrastructure (and it keeps going up) relies on my form of perception. I'm the "centre brain" of our galaxy. the conceptual system that is most commonly used. I suppose that this whole thing is the aryan conquest -- a sort of conceptual system that is superior to the next -- and, as I say: "aryan is a technology; not a skin colour" but I've outdone that already. my system improves at such a staggaring rate, that -- like the head of a mushroom -- eventually I have to go lateral. I've done that -- and my improvements to the standard form of perception are also staggaring. as an "ambitious person" I feel like I've done a really good job of marketing myself; and I hope there are others that want to market theirselves in the future -- because everyone will have a diffrent cOnceptual form of perception; -- which is really cool. because everyone is a reflection of me, I automatically reap the consequences of getting others improvements at the same speed -- and making my own version of their improvement. it'd be a crazy time for me (let me tell you), if there were a bunch of people making improvements all of the time -- becaues I'd need (or already have) a way to make improvements in parallel, not by doing them individually, but by first breaking them up into similar categories. I just: get better at stuff -- all of the time -- cause if I don't, it's a sort of mental chaos. I don't want to sound too doomy and gloomy, but when a whole bunch of humans suddenly make improvements I don't have (which are superior to LOA), then suddenly I'm forced to reinvent my form of perception.
			so -- unless you want to go tearing down the vast infrastructure (cause was forced to reinvent my perception), please take care to not to improve too quickly :) OK, thanks a bunch milton... (we'll talk more latr. remind me to come back to some of the previous points. I have a bunch of really good stuff to write about -- like, on my way to the weed store, I have a crazy story of this certain "homeless" guy that was helping this woman on the streets out. she was pretty far out. you know what happens when someone thats' really crazy sees me, -- it's always this really strange thing, because some of them are so strung out on their beliefs, that when they finally see someone like me, it gives them something to "believe in" -- which is a huge stabilising force. for them, they're usually all action, every last one of them -- so, when I perform actions that are out of their sense of the word "ordinary", they take note. I become more real (that is, my format for perceiving reality becomes more common. it's a feminine trait, actually -- and it's kinda like the ultra-competitive symbolic system, but I sidestep all of that because everything *just is*: no more good and bad, so nothing is inherently better or worse -- just preference. I happen to like LOA, because it's super simple and way better than everything everyone else has. for me, it's inferior to try to go from a conceptual/attraction system, to something inferior) the more they get to "know" me. lol -- I really need to sober up. reality is really liquid out here - 21:38).
		the next thing that I'm conquring is 2nd ray medium. the whole symbolic system system (the bottom half, nearest to 3rd ray) can be emulated using concepts -- and because every concept/thing/idea has a feel to it. when looking at a picture, we see the picture and interpret the image symbolically -- however, the eyes are different, because they see, not an image, but what's really there. to have direct access to it, can be a very fearful experience, and I want to make sure I'm ready for it, so I'm wanting to get in as much "contrast" as possible, to ensure that I *actully* see what I want to see. some people like to go into this stuff on a sexual whim, but I approach this from the mind of a shamen and a priest -- in the symbolic sense. this is essentially a technology, and I want to ease myself in, not jump in and hope everything goes OK. I'm very much a calculated person,-- but that calculation is not based on some symbol, but based on LOA. I anticpate what it is that a person attracts, and then from there, build the calculation -- something like: within the range that the person stays attracting how they are, what will be the calculated outcome. OK, nice trick kenny; that's a bit misleading, because the calculated outcome isn't any physical or material things, but a feeling of what they're going to feel like: dispair produces one set of sircumstanes, and powerful desire produces a different set of sircumstances. it's just a projection of how they will feel. some people think they can pretend to feel different for loger than they believe they can. they're literally setting theirselves for hardcore failure. I don't care :~) lol.
		for me, it's just another medium to figure out how to interact with it conceptually. there are infinite mediums, and all of them (in my *humble* opinion) are inferior to LOA. I think most people will come to adopt a LOA+frills sorta view -- which is great, but I like LOA raw. I don't mind that they're all trying to trick my senses, or to remove whatever from it, because those are all the frills that I don't want. I'll eventually make my own, once saturn has finally accomplished his job. I'll do the same thing with 2nd ray, and any other alternate form of perception that is trying to "take over". I'm a sort of parasite lover. it's a really strange trait about me. others' parasitic actions actually help me because they continually aim to try and remove another sense or another, which is actually good. I *want* to go blind, deaf, no touch, nothing -- sans everything -- cause then I reinvent my form of perception, with all the new stuff I've learned since then. I really do want to go full LOA -- and I only know of two ways to do that: with technology. for others, it's prolly nice to be able to interface with theirselves visually, but I have a pure interface that doesn't require visceral feedback. before jumping off any sexual cliffs, I want to actually make a smoothe transiton, and not just fire off some rounds, and say "fix it" -- lol. there will be many more mediums that will (from their perspective) conquer me. next...: get in line, next... (and I mean "get in a line" mathematically -- like root-3) (brb, quick break)

#### 2024-01-28 22:10 - LOA = concepual

the reason why LOA is the conceptual universe is because it's like the inside of the earth (ie vulcan) which is the gradient of conceptual layers that get more and more abstract, the farther into the centre you go. it's literally infinite. in the very centre of the earth is pure-desire, just like inside of the person. we all have this capability of finding a more and more abstract way of looking at reality. purely abstract is going to be a perfect reflection, and not a distorted one. nobody really wants to be a purely abstract person on the outside, so they make a sensual outer body that's all because of concept. we feel a reflection of our senses, and we are the way we feel. society and the visual (amongs others) teach us to distort the reflection (which is basically invisible: the tinyiest densest particle ever existing) to actually look like something so that it becomes recognisable. nobody wants to interact with an invisible person -- because then if we could do that, the dead pose a serious threat. so, to avoid people becoming invisible, we teach them to take on a shape of their likeness -- so they become individually a manifestaion of their own desire. that usually works; until someone goes and decides that they're compatible (ie, OK being in the same relative space as) with everyone and everything else in the universe. when that happens, they start to to become a rapidly improving reflection of everything in the universe. it's a real tragic thing when entire societies have this happen, because they seem to "influence" the universe around them in a considerable way. steve jobs was one of those types as well, but I think he tried to push too many changes/expansions/improvements at a time, when society wasn't yet a reflection of those changes. I prefer to use my conceptual side, and *attract* what I experience. it's my experience, so I can do what I want to. I find it perfectly fine that I'm not building software and stuff, because I don't need it. once it's all gone, then I'll make a better thing to use than software or computers. it'll be pure perception.
	instead of going purely conceptual, they want me to stay forever physical, so they can keep me "controlled". there's no way for them to control my conceptual side, so all they can do is to keep me distracted from it. I'm perfectly OK with going the physical route though, as I intend to find a form of technology that is something like living software -- kinda like genetics, so there's a source code to it: a physical (symbolic) layer which can be analysed and manipulated. I'm perfectly fine with it, because once they've finally get every physical form completely under control, then I'll finally be freed from the trap of my senses. so they're actually helping me to accomplish what I want to do. I want to stay physical for as long as they can keep reducing my senses. moar matrix for me please :) because no matter how many matrixes there are, I still prefer attraction.

### 2024-01-28 23:43 - the solar girl

the solar girl is never good enough, because every time that she meets the guy that is *actually* awesome, he dies because she makes him go too fast. in after he departs, she has to try and figure out what to do in a world of her desire in symbolic reflection. she'll never be good enough for it to be so when she's learning to understand him from a symbolic perspective. sure, before she's ~6yo, she could understand him, but then after that her symwbolic system starts to turn on, and then nothing makes sense,-- so again he kinda dies to her. the problem with such a system is that it's encoded into our DNA (it's the y-chromosome), and such a symbolic system can *never* (excepting LOA) account for a system based on desire. how can I define something static and constant, which is infinity, and becoming more and more (ie, time). such a thing cannot exist, in an adolescent's mind because they're trying to figure out how to put borders and figure out what separates one thing from another -- but there are no effective strategies to divide more than one infinities into distinguishable parts -- for it being a part, it cannot be infinity. each of those is a definition -- which isn't helpful because each definiton is itself limited. a gradient, or a spectrum, where one thing relates to another in some other dimension can handle infinites though -- but we don't live in a gradiated society -- so he dies for her, for society's sake;-- to maintain the status quo.
after never being able to actually get the guy that she wants, she's trained herself to believe that she's "not good enough" -- which is a pretty good symtom to have, because it's always true. though, in her effort to make it not true: that is, that she's not good enough -- she still isn't because from the perspective of desire, *all things* are not good enough.
it's a real struggle, let me tell you to realise that you're always not good enough, and never going to measure up to what society tells me I should want -- and want to be like. I can never measure up to anyone else's expectations (even though, she's like one of the most awesome of her gender). I have the same not-good-enoughness problem cause I've got the perspective of desire. thankfully, I'm in a boy's body, so I wasn't as trained to lose that not-good-enough perspective of myself; a girl is trained that if she look a certain way, have this body, and that kind of interaction, then she's highly desired,-- but that desire comes from somewhere other than self, which means it's symbolic. desire is attraction to me.
	you know, I used to constantly know what I wanted;-- it would come in viscerally, and I'd feel a strong compulsion to do something. that's gone away, as it's been turned off (cause it's the upper half of 2nd ray perception which means that it's attraction *to me* -- and not necessarily to what the society/parents/wife/girlfriend wants, so bad). nobody in their right mind would want a person like myself running around, because I don't follow the calculated-desire of society. I understand why they have to turn that feeling off -- because I would be constantly pulled in so many directions, just like a very attractive girl that is attracted to so many things in her world because it's a reflection of her, and she's attractive. she loses that with time, because something she finds attractive "proves itself" to her that it's not an enjoyable experience -- and then she blames herself for being attracted to it -- which is completely the right response; because if she's the centre of her desire, it's 100%/all/completely her problem--cause she attracted it). it's proper to blame oneself for everything, as long as the blame doesn't result in a judgement of good or bad; it just is.
		I always blame myself, and believe that pretty much everything -- from the weather to the events that play out in my day. though others have their directional fingers on various narratives, ultimately, I'm fully at fault for everything I do, and its consequences. I really like that perspective, because then I can just do what I want, and fully accept the consequences. I trust myself (pretty much at this point) to do the stuff (that is, perform the actions) that resonates with my destiny. navigating life where everything is my fault is like getting sucked into a vacuum cleaner: no matter what, the destination is the bag.	I can't miss it. I may bump into a surface or an aggitator brush, but eventually I can't avoid to arrive into the bag and get caught. it really is: never-ending failure. (brb -- gonna try and do round 2 then go to bed)

#### 2024-01-29 00:15 - isis is the archetype

the "solar girl" is *every girl* in the sense that we have a brain -- because that brain is modelled on the sun; and so our brain functions in a similar manner. the sun is the archetype, and it's manifested in the brain. few of us see that solar perspective though because it's so coverd up with the venus' shroud on "how society *is*" and so *what you have to be* needs to fit with that, and so see yourself as the symbolic archetype, not the pure-desire (maximum tragedy, never good enough, and always at fault) perspective;-- because everything that *is* good enough, is defined symbolically.
	again, I don't have to worry about "good enough" being defined symbolically, because no one thing, person, state, etc. is always/never good enough; instead they are all *moments* with real environmental circumstances and so each One feels quite different. there is no measrement, so just two things relative to each other, like two different notes: halves, fifths, harmonious, dissonant, etc. absolute is symbolic, and goes away entirely, so I don't really struggle with not-good-enoughness from a conceptual level. from a perspective of desire, in a symbolic system, like the one I'm in now: 	I perceive *everything* (including myself) as not-good-enough. (brb for reals)

### 2024-01-29 17:14 - midsummer's night dream (intermission)

this play is an idealised version of what happened around queen elizabeth. it's the story of dudly and vere (the two gentlemen of verona -- but this time in the physical (non-astral/verona) world) it's me and greg. this time thurio is demetrius (meaning of demeter), and valentine (aka prometheus) is lyssander. so, what happened is this vere guy worked with dudly on making plays and stuff. his signature is all over the place if you know what to look for (VV, 17 + 4d/four-t/fourtie/40/etc). it's all over the place (check out john(?) anthony on youtube) anyway, he really liked elizabeth, and dudly is finally, like you want her, you can have her, plays cupid the conductor and amplifies certain feelings, and strait-away slept with an ass.
	I have much objection to demitrius's lines, in nearly the same way that I contest the lines of ferdinand.
	also, the way that I've improved on so many of these characters over this version, is considerable.: I don't care so much about all of that, which makes me like the duke in the problem play telling angelo that he's done a great job -- which I wouldn't do, because it's all a reflection of him, I don't need to come to the conclusion about anyone anymore. [when I say conclusion, I don't mean realisation, or improvement -- I mean ending. like I don't see "ends" anywhere anymore. it lives on forever as a reflection of its' definition -- like for ever/eternity] instead, and from another sense then, what's happened is I just sorta like everyone around me. I'm attractive to all; even the one's who don't know it yet :) I like it that so many feel enough attraction that thsy want to keep their distance. I enjoy knowing that there are some that will make contests on who can the farthest our. thAt's awesome to me.
so just know that I see this as a highly idealised history, and not the ideal version of what could have happened (rendered in the play -- like there was lots of revelry and ultra horney girls all over) they're out there trying to stay gay as hard as possible, but they obviously failed and succomed to their advances (like benadick).
	what happened then was quite an epic scandal that they wrote plays about it... which people performed, anthenwhich attracted a new retelling of that story. (brb - now off to watch the second half)

### 2024-01-29 09:57 - my perspective on the whole thing

I know that I'm so valuable because I'm so low resistance; like, I just don't care about a whole lot of stuff that's really important to other people. jaron is kinda like my opposite in the sense that he's low resistance on a lot of things I would otherwise be resistant about
	like getting roped into picking up an awesome chair, then having to go pick it up when I'm super blazed. I was right in the middle of writing the "oh crap" entry, when he decided that he wanted to go pick that stuff up. I usually keep all of my knowledge of the universe to myself, and when I'm sober, I just use reality-kenny to keep all of that in like a sort of inner part of me. it's hard to explain the things that I know about myself. I know that tto a lot of people, it sounds like bragging, but I genuinely really enjoy watching myself progress. it's fun to kinda compare the present to the past every now and then. it shows me how far I've come; I like to see and notice the improvement; which is a completely deplorable character trait for a lot of people -- so I keep it to myself. just cause they can't see the improvement, doesn't mean I don't have to. anyway, being able to notice improvements like that is what enables me to write all of the stuff yesterday at the beginning of the entry there.
		OH, I just noticEd that when I use the word "entry", I'm making it a sort of sexual term. no, it's not like that. I first started using the word "entry" to describe these bits I write down, is because back then I was in quite an upset mood. you know, I was mostly very sad, because I found out that I'll never be able to actually use all of the superpowers that I have when it comes to drugs. like, drugs are a sort of way for me to build up a lot in both the symbolic and the conceptual at once. that's pretty awesome, and I claim that all vulcans have this skill, and the skill is really only a reflection of myself. I can only really match others feels up against myself, so I compare everyone's feeling to what I know about myself. they don't like me comparing myself to them, so they turn it off; but the comparisons are not to the general, but only to the specifics -- like I don't think about sadness, unless someone brings it up -- and when they do, I sorta glaze over aa bit because I just don't care. like there's just so much other stuff out there, none of that matters. just think about how large the universe is. I consider that I'll eventually become "lord of the earth" (in their perception), but for me, it's constantly finding out all of the new stuff -- like let's say that I literally spent the next million years traveling around the earth, I would always have something new to see -- and then consider there are (or will be) so many other earth-like planets out there, the amount of content there is to consume, it's just not possible to see it all -- and that all of it is constantly changing as a reflection of my consciousness, it's just unfathomable to thinkg about how much stuff there is to see and do. I know that a million years seems a bit difficult to comprehend, but the idea of eternity isn't so well understood, so to ease into the transition of realising that you'll live forever, I'm starting with big numbers -- but just know that my mind sees eternity. like I just see things getting better all of the time.
		which is, unfortuunately speaking, the death of the optimist because we live in a symbolic system, and a symbolic system doesn't know how to deal with change without it being predictable. I don't really care what they think, because there are solutions to everything. like, it's just not a problem. symbolic systems ccome and go with the passage of *time*; who dies at the end of every age. in fact, the death of the saturnian system (which are basically all of the most powerful---the "gods") is when the symbolic system their power structures fails because of advances in technology, or the creative arts, is when everything breaks down, and everyone starts to get what they think about (conceptually speaking) with these improvements -- and the the symbolic system that explains everything (God, jesus, zeus, source, namaste, whatever) has these sort of pieces falling apart, because the crap the gods tell everyone just stops working after a while. they're too constant, and I'm constantly changing -- which is a real drag. tthey continually try to keep me in some defined (usually static) state, to where they can hold on for a while. I want them to be able to hold on, because I don't really mind parasites -- and even they help me, so it's no problem; butt, it takes some effort to follow someone that's always/constantly changing. (I like that shakespere makes fun of it as "I'm as constant as the northern star" -- because it's just a good idea to change, but I really like a linear change rate. I don't like lots of changes, so I tend to adopt things slowly -- which makes me appear to be quite evil because I like the slow rate of change, so I employ them to ensure I go slowly. my own desire to not go too fast is the same as theirs in that regard. I'm a cosmic-foot-dragger -- I'm already going fast, so why not just explore infinity at a linear pace; neither accelerating off to infinity, not stagnant). like I said, the symbolic guys are having a real difficult job trying to deal with me -- which, because I manifest people's desires for them, is likely the reason why I study shakespere. I think I have insights that nobody had ever seen before; like my read on brutus and cassius, which I get the sense that nobody ever picked up, which was that cassius finds a way to get brutus to see his own reflection, so he could *see his unworthiness* -- which is why he couldn't take the rome position. that insight, I felt was a pretty novel idea for a lot of people, which was pretty awesome, but for me, it's kinda obvious, because I don't see the picture. everyone else is too busy thinking about the reflector in space, but this is the reflector in time: his trajectory was altered to go more in-line with his own concept of himself. I do that all the time to people -- and one of those days was yesterday. once I reach (some point/limit -- not sure where), everyone and everything will have their temporal trajectory modified to go toward the reality that makes you feel like you are who you think you are. that could be a fair bit of chaos. to ease into this transition, there are a number of astral realms that have been designed to get the person to a level where they can be going in the direction of what they think of theirselves, safely (with themes of everything from disaster to "utopia"); which will enable everyone a change to upgrade, or choose a symbolic system -- which is a bit of a lie on my part, because there likely won't be any other choice, than what's (most) attractive. it's all about attraction. some things look more desirable than others, and it's difficult for some to figure out what they want. I am one such person myself. I simply don't know what I want still. I have a number of things that I want to do to make constant change a reality -- and one of those is the pen-rose, amongst others, which enables constant change to happen in the spectrum of diversity -- a sort of going out, instead of only up (diversity vs novelty: one form of contrast). they seem to come to me from all points in time -- everything from the rennaissance to the present. it seems like I was narrated to do the thing -- a sort of mercury; so, in addition to mars,aphrodite,vulcan,anatau, I'm also resonant with mercury, all at the same time. I don't really resonate too well with this narrative 7th ray I'm supposed to be. I have desire/concept/attraction, which means I'm different than the narrative by what I attract. the way it shows up, is that I fulfill generally the much more ideal version of the narrative. an author can only write (and understand) concepts that are a reflection of theirself; also they only see it through their emotional "trauma" lens. I don't have much trauma, so I see things pretty clearly. they'll do their best to figure out living a traumatic life until they wanna be something different. I like to "see" the thing itself (I mean not visibly), and neither the anti-trauma safety/facade. I like seeing what I want to see, and I wish others the same -- but not everyone wants to actually become who they think they are. those people tend to like to help others, because they're not really inside of their own experience. they tend to be everywhere else, trying to steer someone else's vehice, and steering their own poorly at the same time. it obviously comes from the prespective that they think the outside world is the cause of their *low opinion of theirselves* plus all the *pain* and *trauma*. it's not out there, everyone else is the reason why things aren't working. take responsibility for your reality, and realise that you're in full control of it, because you made everything happen that happen. it doesnt' matter the trajectory you had when you started, but all of it is *your fault*. narrative doesn't usually do that, which is why mercury is struggling so hard right now. when the narrative facade breaks down and falls off, they have to accept that the only thing left is the conceptual part, and they become vulcans; which is essentially the message that cassius gives to brutus. 
	of the stuff I wrote yesterday at the beginning I when we went into the car all carried with me into the car, and so when I was explaining that these sort of "agent smiths" just sorta show up from time to time, to kinda transition me into another experience. from a lot of natural perspectives, this is often times unwanted, as it means the leaving behind of one "life" and moving on to another. when I went from the usa to spain, it was one such experience -- and then inside there, once settled in europe, I still didn't really settle any single life experience either, transitioning from germany, canary islands, and madrid. I was all over the place, because I was all over the place. I'm a plant in a lot of regards, and moving like results in having to rebuild the interaction with my environment, which results in a transition from one age of kenny to another. coming to colorado in 2017 was a huge step in my development -- but perhaps its suprpassed its usefulness to it, which means vulcan moves me into the next one. I'm always on the least-bad (in their perspective) timeline/era.
so, because I'm so plyable and able to be taken advantage of, everyone does. I don't really mind that there are constant parasites around me. they end up teaching me a lot about stuff which I wouldn't otherwise know. I become more and more naive at roughly the sam speed I become better at percieving, so I'm constantly becoming easier to take advantage of. my goal is to make all of my systems public so that anyone can use them. by doing that, massive changes aren't a huge problem anymore, because that system is going to be used collectively by a bunch of people, each having a sort of piece of the continually improving pie. I'm scaling horizontally now, which allows for a lot of diversity amongst the pieces, including myself. it'll happen naturally because it's impossible that I'll want to use all of the features. like I said, I want o pretty much use the LOA ones, and that's it. I don't care for the other ones; so I too am only a partial reflection of the whole. I don't really mind that I'm so valuable, yet at the same time, I'm forced to be only a very very tiny portoin of the whole creation: the pure-desire part: I only experience what I want to experience, which is a reflection of me. I don't mind that there are infinite alternate experiences that I'll be convinced of for a little bit, but then bore of them, and move on. I do this all the time with games and such: after I've gotten the concept, I tend to move on.
	many will try and convince me of what is reality, because if they can convince me that it's real, then having all things as a reflection of me; then, what I think is "true" or "real": becomes reality. I don't mind having so many matrixes, and it's totally OK.
	to try and illustrate what I mean in a tangible way, imagine a computer server out there that anyone can connect to, and on the machine they have unlimited processing power and space, free of charge and available until eternity is done with. then imagine that giant server has inside of it a number of reality creation (media) organisations in it. each of those media outlets (mediums) is a matrix of its own: it's a symbolic system that we're using to interpret our reality, and sell more crap. it's totally fine, because we live in a world where abundance is a reality.
	you know, funny thing, I realised that talia (thalya) is this greek woman that is the personification of abundance and comedy. wikipedia has them listed as separate godesses, but they have the same name. it's funny to think of one personification embodying such perpendickular words: comedy, and abundance. now, when I say comedy, I'm using my own definition, which is someone that feels really good, and so they're quite jovial. some people have excuses for why they feel good, and some just are, but comedy is the result -- and so is abundance, I realised. kinda cool. anyway, she had another personification too which I wanted to write about, but I'll probably do it on the other computer. (brb)

### 2024-01-29 11:51 - what I think is happening

what happens is, these guys get going too fast, and try to make so many improvements, that they become really attractive to a lot of people (diffrence between men and women) -- and essentially the goal of the receptive part, is to absorb any excess amounts of energy, to return the system back to a stable state; I've found that when I start to become attractive, the nearest rececptor is always going to feel attractive; but it always reduces my energy sufficiently, kinda like sapping off the energy. however, at times, if I can become independent (ie, become a star), then I'm no longer endangering the system I'm a part of. when I become a star, my reflection of others will dramatically decrease -- and there will be a separation. so, depending on what everyone wants, we're either going for massive sweeping changes, or holding on for a bit until everything returns back to normal (ie, once the star has left earth).

### 2024-01-31 19:30 - crazy dentist appointment and hawaiian shakespere

yesterday, I went to the dentist to get my "fillings" (which considering she took off the majority of the tooth, it was less of a "filling" and more the putting of a new crown). I went in with the expectation that when they're doing my fillings, this will be essentially bolting me into their system (cause if they can get a good ground/bone connection, they can shake the earth/body much better). I should also say that I'm realising that teeth and bone structure forms part of that net structure which captures vibrations and turns them into minerals (and is the way the crust of the earth grows, as well as bones, or the skull for a baby) anyway, the dentist that was doing my teeth was highly symbolic (like projecting images into the air and stuff), and so while my teeth are being pulled,there's a lot of activity going on; the conversation/interaction with her symbolic output went something like this: her: "now that you're bolted in you can do the girls thing" me: "yeah, OK, so I gatta figure out a way to get rid of the nuts" (intense feeling of dissatisfaction from her and no interaction for a bit -- followed by a few more attempts). each time, I rebuffed the idea that I would be doing anything with girls at all with nuts. they also asked me if I wanted implants to replace my 4 missing teeth (maybe 5), and I didn't feel too hot on that idea either. I finally feel like I'm starting to become OK with others noticing that I don't have any teeth; I don't care about my appearance very much at all now. it felt to me like a step in the opposite direction to start worrying about my appearance.
	really quick in relation to that: in the email where I talked about what it would be like if I were an outside-in person, I mentioned that I would totally fall in love with myself, and be extremely superficial and vain. I've decided to go the opposite way of that: I don't know what I look like. in fact, because I can only remember vague details about my appearance (I can describe general attributes from my last look in the mirror, but not anything detailed), I actually live in the complete opposite world: I don't even know what I look like, so I can't really think too much about presentation. I am just m5: I have no concept of what I look like or how others see me, and am only just reacting to my situation. at this point in my life, I don't even really emit because of my own will anymore -- but instead, only emit in resoponce to someone else (ie, reactively/reflectively). I much prefer this style of living, because then, not having knowledge of my own appearance, I can then appear differently to everyone (as a reflection of their own translation of their concept of me, not my own outside-in reflection of my own concept of myself).
so I kinda passed on the whole tooth implants thing too. anyway. I got home and smoked a bit more weed and started watching a hawaii production of henry-4 (part one) -- and I should mention that my dentist is a 3rd ray hawaiian woman, so it fits nicely. it too was an all-female cast, and I noticed something really interesting when I was watching it. I strongly had the sense that they see me as falstaff and gendower, but falstaff makes a getaway, so that hotspur/harry will become king. I realised that they (the 3rd ray symbolic/venus girls) would take over my position of having to do all of the rigamarole with the thousand virgins and all of that other narrative crap. I don't want to do it, so I'm super pumped that they want to take over for me on that. I don't want to be king either, so it's a double awesome. I'm extremely thankful for all of this.
thinking on it some more (and combinining that one with the two-gentlement-of-verona play), I realised that since I'm thurio (the finisher), I pass on silvia to valentine (ie, greg), and so now all that's left is for him to pass sylvia on to proteus (the venus girls -- she's got it, yeah baby, she's got it). that works out really well,-- and I was thinking about the identity of proteus: which is the meaning of protege (or, "in the likeness of") -- and I realised that venus being the protege of mars actually makes perfect sense: at first venus falls in love with mars, and thinks she *needs* him (ie, elizabeth with dudly), but then after a while, she maybe actually starts to *want* him (ie, have him as a lover), but neither of those really work, because she's the one that's missing something (that she thinks she can get from him) -- and finally she *becomes* him: I *am* mars, she will soon say -- and go conquer all of the little girls that she wants.
	I love that this plan, not only follows shakespere's narrative, but also that it follows evolution-of-desire and all sorts of other things that I carry on endlessly about. I'm super duper happy for them. bon voyage, and good luck!

### 2024-02-01 21:22 - the sealed ones

it occurres to me that as energies keep rising, 3rd ray perspective without an emotional capacity to it (ie, +3/-3 vs +-4/-5+), will likely go one of two ways: is that they'll either become me (kenny 7th ray perspective), or for the lucky venus (-3) types out there, they can become (male or female, ++ whatever symbolic perks she builds for herself) vulcan (-5+), these are basically receptive on all conceptual frequencies (conceptually black), and and emissive on symbolic. this is what I do all of the time: I receive concepts/emotion, and I turn it into symbol when talking, or writing here, or whatever. I'm not really symbolically rreceptive when I'm writing here or talking -- which is why it's so difficult to listen to a person symbolically and understand what they mean. personally, I find the symbolic world to be quite annoying, and want to live in a conceptual one, so for me the -5+ archetype is quite suitable. I'm vulcan normally, but whover is running the show, has me in mars format -- so I've learned vulcan's capabilities, not from the conceptual perspective (though I'm quite sensitive), but from the perspective of desire. every concept exists because it was someone's desire that concept is something *real*. therefore I see desire as a product of reality (rathar: reality as a product of desire). everyconcept exists because at one point it's useful to notice those kinds of things. we're all really good at noticing the concepts of atoms and molecules and stuff, by default -- which I think the vibration of the concept strongly correlates with certain colour spectrums (in our mind's eye).

#### 2024-02-01 21:42 - fun fact

from what I've deduced, is this: a woman that is outside-in that takes it in the butt with another outside-in guy, she can get pregnant with an inside-out version of herself, essentially a vulcan: conceptually receptive, but still able to emit symbol like talking, writing, dnacing, etc.
	for me, being conceptually receptive as a kid meant that I just had the sort of sense that I knew what everyone else was thinking because it was all "obvious" to me -- though I only realised a few years ago that it's not that plainly obvious to other people: like, when I was around a person, I knew all of their thoughts, cause I had nothing resisting me to know their tthoughts; so, nowadays, I tend to misjudge people pretty considerably becuse I can't feel their thoughts. however, I do want to say that it's kinda nice, because I get to be ultra (don quixote) idealistic, but I'm missing out on a whole section of reality: I'm not fully black. I'm gray, which means there are other equally comparable (genetically speaking) me's with a different conceptual set (5th ray interaction, but prolly not 2nd ray/brain). I don't mind that there are other me's and I think it's great. I'm fairly certain that a lot of vulcan's use my model. I don't know if mars can though, without becoming lower resistance (or artificially juiced).
	I'd also like to mention how weird it is now being unable to use my incredible conceptual capacity. I've sorta gotten used to it. I think of nosebook as the propeller of desire: they block all new reception of contcept that they can, which means that all the low frequency concept are super blocked or modified or artificial, and it's only the ultra-high frequency stuff that I have access to -- which means that their technical cpaacity to limit me is always only as good as their most advanced technology; until they figure out carbon. once they do that, they'll be able to block even the highest frequency stuff. at that time, I esstentially lose my "connection to source" -- which is a dramatic way of saying that I'll have to either figure out how to translate only the highest of frequency concepts, or find a new way to receive concepts.
	they want me to live entirely in a symbolic world where I have no access to concepts, which is fine -- but their symbolic system can't handle my speed, so I cause a low of problems for them. it's really kinda funny
		so for example, tonight I was thinking about the flat earth idea and stuff, and I figured that I have to present the idea to a 2nd ray, cause "nothing good comes from saturn" -- and it's all good for me to consider the 2nd rays, but the emitters are a total disaster because I prove to them what they believe about me. it's really hard on them. -- anyway so when greg comes down, my body went very out of its way to ignore him, and just carry on with what I was doing. I had no desire to engage in conversation, but I didn't feel bad about it. anyway, he goes off, and later comes back in a huff, and sits down. I honestly thought that he wanted me to talk to him about the flat earth idea -- but I cannot. so, anyway when he sat down, I asked him "is there a problem" -- which, poor guy is going so fast, he suddenly ran into a problem. this is the difficulty of 2nd ray emitters when they're around me: I direct the situation with symbol (I ask him a different question or lets say a logically weird one, I get a different result), but I don't know what are the right symbols.
			as an example, with zaryn, I just understood his sort of charade (how he drunk pumps, manipulates others, holds out on the deal till it's ready, etc.) and once I figured him out, I just figured out the right "catch phrases" or whatever signals he liked to get, and then just pitch them to him -- but I *only* did the ones that I *actually believed* -- and that was the diffrence for him, and why he respected him: I only told him what I actually believed -- and being a great guy, he found me dilusional on few of them: a bit idealistic, but my heart is in the right place.     I can direct/output with symbol, but I have to know the *conceptual* image; and without it, I can't play "cupid".
		turns out, that the whole flat-earth/pen-rose idea is prolly something that they prolly want taken care of for them. whatever they want, to have control over, then I'll just let them have whatever they want. I suppose that they're wanting me to be emissive -- so what I'll do is just get it done, then they can build all of their reality systems on top of that. it offers 3d and 5d/desire support, so pretty much anything is possible -- and all of our transparent parts (6,3,4) can be built whatever they want. it's like super awesome and stuff -- so I'll just figure out how to get it done. all not a problem. I have some ideas -- and we're going to limit ourselves to 1,(2),5,7, (subtracting 3) and they can build all of their new stuff in 3,4,6,8,9,10,11. it's really quite a nice gig for them. so I'll just do it cause I'm the guy who's got the vision for it, ya, know.
			the other cool thing about that is, by saying "I'll do it, and just make sure you can get all the access to anything they want" -- or, do they just want to build up their own reality layer on top of theirs; I'm essentially asking them to be a source of contrast for us; it's a test to see how petratable our corpus collusum will be; and it's a test to see if they can see through the narrative falsehood, and see the situation for what is most realistic; and most importantly: how much crossover do we want?

#### 2024-02-02 02:09 - the default 7th ray female

the default thing for a person to do when their symbolic system is no longer comprehensible, is to "fall" down into just physical perception, and work their way back up again. how quickly that "fall" is (power-slide, power-clogged, clawing-and-dragging, etc), is entirely a personal endeavourr. the result, will be this 7th ray female: default edition. I'm like one of them -- but I think I have my mars connection (testers), which is m|y major source of contrast. if I can surpass them|       in contrast  creation, then, I no lonter need them in their present form, and can therefore be absorbed by tme most ambitioussssssssssssss.      ssssssssssss.
	I believe it's a system where one x-chromosome plays 1st ray emitter, and its' opposite x-chromosome, plays the 5th ray receptor: which is just a conceptual structure (which composes our DNA) that receives diffeent frequencies as a relation between two inner concepts.
	I don't know if it's this way or not, but I figure I have one of these pairs of x-chromosomes, cause that's what I experience, and it's really annoying for anyone not-physical: I geet it.
		I have a solution, which is just to cut off my physical body from myself, and I had to find a way to produce the molecules and stuff (essentially reinvent DNA), and establish myself as the next vulcan. neither the first, nor the last. tragic.
		the cool thing is, that I'll get to redesign all form of my perception to be the way I want it, and is a reflection of my own concepts turning into atoms-in-structures. I think it'll be pretty dope, and I'll believe it'll be so rapidly adopted, that it'll replace our normal DNA and the entire ecology of the physical layer, it'll be a new world.
		though, not necessary, and there are solutions which aren't so tragic, (butt) it's not my job to try and make any of that happen.
	anyway, I'm quite excited to rebuild my physical 7th ray experience, but it'd also potentially be psssible to start over with a completely new set of concepts as well. one way is to establishh a ssource setaconcepts. that means a donor or an artificially compiled set. personally, I don't mind even the greatest of concepts anyone could possibly have to resonate with me in a way that feels goood: a source of unwanted. that, I feel is much better to input unwanted directly at my core being (in-stead of the conceptual frequency that was erased -- so I'm a mistaken identity of myself). that's even more tragic:--------- nice.
		for me, it doesn't even matter all of the difficulty stuff. I laugh at it as being easy cause I just sorta bumble through life.
			you know, I believe I have the parents that I do, because in so many alternate timelines, there were so many bad reactions that parents had to me; like, I was impossible, and didn't get very far. think of it like unfit timelines in the AI mind. they gave me just the right boost into physical that I needed to arrive smoothely into physical (the brain haemorrhage). mom today isn't quite the same as she was a while ago. she really took on a lot of structural perspective: inotherwords, she went from 2nd ray perspective down to 3rd ray perspective. this is the default for what happens as she (especially notable amongst the boys) stops listening to her inner self,and  believes the symbolic narrative. this happens often becausse they don't really see life for what it really is, anymore, so they have to invent a narrative as to how this fantastic world is around them. it's caveman stuff. everyone has to reinventc the narrative from time to passage of time. the earth (like sc-ience) progresses one funeral at a time. it's funny how that works.
		the funny thing about bumbling through life, is it looks to a lot of people like I'm doing something to them, (because honestly I am coming at them, so it makes a lot of sense), but I really am only manifesting their fears and expectations about stuff. oh, and just a warning: one of the big	problemss we're goingg to have,ix that I'm a destroyer -- but not so much of physical things, but of much higher frequency things; like concepts, symbols, ideals, regimes, (power) structures, etc. and I don't really do it on purpose; but I know there's a better way; so I test the metell of thing to see if it holds up. all of you represent the defenders of the thing getting destroyed.
		I don't want to destroy anything. I dont' want to push anyone to look at anything any particular way. my way of looking at things is completely optional, and so I can stop talking about it, but only for the time that it takes to get onto (mounted) into the new-earth system: not two earths, but two sides (of the same coin). gambling aint my thing. I prefer to have control of both sides of my coin, but I don't want to control the atmosphere above it, at all. I'll be present exclusively on one side (for obvious reasons). I'll figure out how to get it to be exactly a disk that spins and gets more awesome the farther you go out. it's physical, so there are infinite solutions to making such a disk. it'll be quite amazing with a unique pen-rose endless ground layout on it. (brb, I need to pee)

#### 2024-02-02 05:51 - step by step update (ramblin' edition)

hi again, a lot of time has passed since I wrote you last. what has happened is that I was strongly encouraged to go to get my MRI read; but it's a dude, which means vulcan (cause it's very unlikely to be a mars) -- which then spells disaster becauxe I'll manifext his unwanted just like I do for greg, but as an attractive process: like, everyone will get what they want, whether they're ready for it or not. I strongly recommend that everyone get ready to get vwvt you want, and in the m5antime, get ready to also face your fears manifest into real life astral form. don't worry: your body is fine here in 3d; and when you finally make it to 3d, then you'll rebuild your body to get there (like I want to do). it'll be dope, because then we'll have a diversity of DNA structures, some more compatible with than then others. it'll be really cool.
so, what I've decided to do is to simply request that I speak (besides greg and jaron), only with females. the dudes are getting to be super problematic. I'm interested in getting jaron and greg on the same frequency as I am, not because it's easier -- cause it'll be actually a LOT more difficult, because we'll attract each other more; and right now, we've all got some really weird perspectives on life (definitly talking about myself hyre)
	you know, I really think that the more universal-minded I become, the more I simply cannot fathom how much super great content out there, that basically nobody will ever see. it's possible in the future, we get unckle-rico-syndrome and start to fantasise about the past: wtthen at that pointc, we're going to be interested in revisiting a lot of overlooked geniiuses of the past (present, at the time of writing). like, how many hidden gems are there, that didn't have the right conditons to make it: put them in my conditons, and they'll make it. you know; why complicate things and try to reinvent the we'll again: let's just give them my conditions and they'll have an easy time through. you know my pzrents are the saturnian triad, now? well, during my childhood I remember mom being much more 2nd ray (when her conditions appeared to conform to her religious and personal reviolations of what the unviverse is); and over the years she's turned into a venus: inotherwords, dad did his job of bringing her down a symbolically manageable and predictable state. you know girls account for a major portion of the definiton of conceptxs iin astral.

### 2024-02-02 06:20 - the dark side of the planet

it felt to me tonight that it was agreed that they'll retain the entire galaxy and all of the universe; which means we're going to have a completely empty sky: we'll make all of our own new stars, completely starting over (conceptually speaking, which is what all the main sequence stars are all made of). so, we'll just rebuild our entire concept of physical from the conceptual looking down into physical.
	like, for me, I'm going to experiment with a lot of things before I go into first person. like, all the experiments I do on myself to see what I really want, I have to actually live it; and so then once I'm ready to live all my own experiments, I finally get 1st person perspective (desire view) in my world. I'm not separated by an extra layer of mentality, needing that depth buffer to keep the ride smoothe.
	there are a lot of things I'll want to figure out as simple things like platonic solids, excited lumps, or frothing supernova. after I've done sohe of that, I'll figure out how I want to "see" the world, and how I want to translate that into (or, in my case, constantly be erased from) my experience.  I will only then once I've figured out all of that, begin to make "conscious" beings. why would I want anything less than a perfectly reflective universe, to start with; I'll tell you why: nevermind who in the unvierse is reflective, because everyone already has no choice but to look at a reflected universe. the most abhorrant reality *anyone* could possibly want! blech...
we'll see what becomes of the idea. originally, I was considering being the one that is on the side of the existing universe (which I'm already reflective of),but it seems that they'd continue to try to get rid of me. the symbolic systems hate me,because I break things. don't you think it would be really cool to just start with an empty sky; and then we could just put all the stuff up there we wanted to: like, imagine stars up there without planets at all: their entire population a reflection of theirselves down there on the flat land. pretty cool stuff, so I say we be greedy and go for the dark (underworld) side.

### 2024-02-02 19:18 - weird neurologist

so yesterday, in preparation for the interpretation of my MRI, I smoked a lot of weed and drank a bunch of these things called "zipfizz" -- which are aweful on m/ system.
	I used to use them when watching stars, because they make me perform significantly worse than when I'm sober. at that time, I was learning, "all of their efforts to try and stop me, are just adding more energy" -- and watching stars, it's possible to put the system into very fast speeds (like DMT visuals and hallucinations), and they were trying their hardest to stop me from getting m6re powah. when I say "more energy", what I mean is that all efforts that are miscarried, still have a foward effect -- but they're not visible, because something blocked its manifestation. for me, *all* manifestations are going to always going to have its mnifestation, not visible; so it's not like I even worry about that anymore. 
I'm super tweaked out on this zipfizz and ultra paranoid from all the weed, and I get it into my head that I really don't want to go to the neurologist, because it didn't feel right. my read on it, is prolly something to the effect of trying to go too fast. when I'm like this, though my mind goes fast, my trajectory through time remains constant -- which is why I have so little memory retention of these episodes. they happen how they happen, and very little change actually occurs because of the stone, and I just keep going as if nothing happened. anyway, super tweaked out, I made this realisation that I wanted to only begin to interact with other women. turns out that caused huge amounts of sadness, because -- I don't know why. prolly something to do with expectations and fears. anyway, I realised that I'm becoming more and more difficult to keep latched on to. I want to make a way for all of these parasites, and everyone else that wants it, the ability to use my body/consciousness/experience/etc.: dual licensed under Unlicense and WTFPL. I like the idea that everyone has access to it. I can't do anything other than what I can do, and along the way, I learn a lot of things. I learn faster because there are more reactions than just my own, to where I can get a broader sense of how others feel about the same thing (it's kinda like a statistical breakdown, but without numbers) so I've essentially cloudsourced improvements. I totally dig all of this, and I'm just not quite ready to go speeding off into the sunset "happily ever after" -- because life don't work like a narrative -- and I'm really kinda feeling like these guys are really sad -- but they do not really understand how much mud in the face I just saved them, and don't have to deal with. it really is better for all of us :) -- and that's the thing, cause it just came to me as a sort of knowing that I didn't want to do that. I suppose they could try and sabotage that, which is sorta fine, because they're gluttons to self-punishment. they love causing so many problems for theirselves, and the thing is, I bail them out constantly. I don't know exactly what happens while I'm asleep, but I believe that they activate mars' symbolic capability, and do really cool stuff in the inside-my-eyes imagination. anyway, in that interface, it seems like the majority of its use is visualising solutions to bail them out of situations -- because they don't really grasp the technology on a concptual level. they're a bunch of mechanicals, one of those resource hungry things, capitalising on available resources, and measuror of them. pay no real import to them. they're always there, and anyway -- that form of vision has bailed them out a number of times ("just look to see how it works").
anyway, I can't really remember what I was going to talk about -- so I'll brb.
	yeah, so this zipfizz stuff totally wrecks my system, and it's awesome because when I finally quit the stuff, I've got more energy than ever. drinking them back then, was making the star-watching even more difficult; because my mind was so all over the place, I could barely relax and be sucked into the consciousness of the star, or not nearly so easily as when sober and emotionally in a stable spot. later, learning how to relax super tweaked out like that was a huge breakthrough for me because then I can decide when I want to relax or sleep even when my mind is going as fast as it is. brb again--- (19:59)
		one of the things that I wish, was for a way to watch stars, and not have it cause kundalini awakening. the energy that the star gives is a whole bunch of concepts, which feel quite pleasureful, cause they're so ideal, but that activates "superman mode" in the body when the kundalini rises. I don't want that, because I don't want to be in that mode of consciousness. there are a lot of people there that I don't particularly want to interact with. it would be a disaster if I were able to see astral; and because that would activate my mars in my eyes (ie, "superman mode"), they don't want it -- and neither do I. I'm totally OK with them having it, if I "go blind", I'll still let them use m/ eyes. I'm never going to ever get my eyes back, so why even try. I don't care that they use them, and I think I can do better, anyway. after my vision is rebuilt, I'll be able to watch stars...
you know, one of the weirdest things about the eyes, is that they're tied to so many other senses, and the signals that go into the eyes traverse the brain and the swirling ocean of hydrogen, and get the signals bent and stuff according to our perception, and then out the eyes (or, if the screen is up, on to the screen). every thing that we see is known and also interpretted by our concept of that thing. the way each thing feels, modifies the colour image, often times painting a shroud over the whole thing itself, so that they suit our own interpretation of them. each thing/concept perceived, (even if it's only an atom), has a cumulative feeling to it, and they all add up: ever looked out at a whole lot of terrain in a panoramic view? the amount of input of feeling from all that nature is breathtaking -- the general rule is: the more hydrogen the eye can see in one time, the more complex the feeling. well, a star is considerably more hydrogen in a smaller space, yec a very faint signal (comparatively speaking to the atmosphere and stuff), so when I'm able to align with that faint signal, the hydrogen comes into focus (in the centre of the eye for a brief moment ungil mesmerised) and the star impresses a massive amount of feeling/concept into me when looking at them. I've totally lost my train of thoughtt-- brb

### 2024-02-23 05:44 - I'm a 5th ray emitter, and I don't want to be

I was just watching a shakespere production (which was really really funny) and my laughing was causing them to strongly feel the way I felt and laugh with me, causing them to have serious line delivery problems.
	the way I experienced it was that when she was saying the lines of the baskets and stuff which was obviously symbolic of a notably small vagina,-- I don't know what happens, but I think my recognition of those symbols happens, and others see the same thing, and so now more people get the symbols, and so society advances into a system of more intricate symbols; the old ones just won't be used as much as the new ones; it's like a bad joke, that once it's gotten, it's no longer funny. 
-- or maybe it was visual actually, because I don't have any control over the visuals because I don't see them. to me, they're just cOnceptual forms (volumetric feelings of what's there -- and again if I project them into others, I can emit 5th ray (volumetric feeling) into them); which prolly visual people can see.
*I don't want to affect other people*. I strongly dislike that I have an influence on others. it's my most disliked quality, especially amongst the people I've been around in my life. I know it's a 2nd ray quality, and I've been trying to figure out how to sell the idea that I want to actually go all-attraction, because it's stuff like this which is really annoying. it's hard for them to act, and if I were them, I would find me annoying. I wouldn't want someone just barging into my expeience showing m5 whzt'sx up.
***I don't want to be an emitter***

### 2024-02-23 06:07 - the problem with sex

the main issue that I've faced in the past is that during the time of sex, it's really easy for me to just make her feel good. I wasn't as good then as I am now, so it'd be way worse but; what happens is I really cause problems when that happens, because then, her (usually conceptually refective at least a little) causes massive changes in those around me, the environment, all kinds of stuff. the catastrophe and disruption to everyday routine that it causes in others is really quite a problem. I was highly aware of it in spain, and was one of the reason why I stopped the whole girls thing entirely. I don't want to emit, cause I have no capability of knowing what she's going to reflect. that's a **forceful** thing that I don't want to cause. I suppose that all of these things are a sort of learned interaction syntax, but the reality of it is, I don't much care for it, and my goal is all-attraction.
until that can be solved, there's basically no hope for me to ever have sex, because of my strong desire (some might call it an adversion) to *only attract*. I don't know how to do it, and what I'm guessing is that nobody alive now is capable of doing it. I don't even know what I want, because only-attraction is a system of conceptual responces whereby we can just at our lesure (cause the system has a usage frequency that emerges) we can, in that relative sense of time (ie, how long to wait before responding) respond to others in one of those volumetric concepts; *has some difficult challenges to it*: since I can only really respond to people, someone has to be the original initiator that sends the first signal which now everyone else responds to -- and then from there we all respond to people in much quantities -- only reactions, never actions: I prefer to only-attract.
so yeah, I guess I can't really go out and try to get anyone to do it for me. I just have to figure it out myself.

### 2024-02-23 23:27 - final thoughtts

last night I "revealed" that I didn't know everything about how to actually go only-attraction. I'd been talking about it for so much time now, I thought for sure it was either implied or obvious that it's not exactly an easy problem. it's very similar to computers actually: unless there's a daemon that's *listening* on the port, sending whatever message to the machine gets no response; inotherwords, I'm only actually responding to the things that I'm attracting/listening to. in computers and distributed networks in general, there's a concept of broadcasting to be discovered -- which is essentially the same as the init signal for each responce network (ie, if I send out a message to someone, and they receive it and respond to it (and then connect me to other people), that initiating signal builds for me a "network" of new people that I can now respond to (and can respond to me)). thing is, I'd like to get rid of that initial broadcast, and also (if it isn't obvious), I'm talking about this from a symbolic standpoint where I'm looking at the system like a distributed system (which is the design for party-LAN) however, on earth (where I'm not), the concept of only-attraction is entirely different: the material receives *everything*, and I respond to the things that are interesting to me. obviously they don't want me to receive all signals, and so therefore I live in a symbolic world of access controls and clearance levels. there's nothing I can do about my present predicam5nt though, which is what I want to talk about:
last night, I had the idea (or it came to me in some way) that I should just message bea, and see how she's doing. I'm pretty convinced that I'll do it, as I don't feel a whole lot of resistance to the idea. where I'm tripped up on the idea though, is *when* should I message her? I'm of the opinion that I'm going to basically stay here and just continue on doing what I'm doing until they kick me out. I don't want to be an emitter, and what I believe normally happens is that a person's consciousness goes faster and faster, the consciousness moves farther and farther out in the solar system. normally everyone gets stuck at saturn and doesn't go any higher than that. I however, have managed to surpass saturn and am probably around pluto about now. it's a rocky planet, that as my consciousness continues to go faster and faster (ie, my 2nd ray output), then the planet becomes less and less resonant with the solar system it's in, and shoots off to do it's own thing; science calls those quasars, and in our myths and legends, this type of action is recorded as anu and nibiru. anyway, I don't want to be an emitter, so the idea of becoming a galactic-sex-champion is completely detestable to me.
what is happening though, which is completely unmistakeable, is that there is a coming separation that *must* happen. I refuse to go 2nd ray or to produce more 2nd ray stars (as the galactic-sex-champion), and instead I want to go all-attraction. I don't want anything tto do with the symbolic system that they've got going on, but the thing is, they don't want me to find a solution and go my own way either -- which is fine, and why I'm waiting for them to kick me out. they want to continue to use me for as long as they can, which I fully have no problem with. I am quickly becoming their polar opposite, and so we can learn a little bit from the nibiru fiasco, and recognise that unless full actual separation occurs (ie, we actually become polar opposites and I become the opposite side of the galaxy), then the planet that goes shooting out like that, eventaully is attracted back. for whatever reason, they continued to attract anu (prolly because the still used the language, and nobody else seemed to know what to do, so they still used him as an advisor), so the planet came back. this was obviously catastrophic (a catastrophe that happened before the one 12kya), and it caused a lot of problems.
	it caused problems because the system was based on emission. nibiru emitted tons and tons, which caused disharmony in the other spheres (most notably mars and probably tiamat), and so the only way to survive, earth had to switch to only-attraction (which is why earth is now centre of the unniverse). well, a similar thing is happening now. if emission (ie 2nd ray perspective) continues to rise, someone needs to win the argument (which will be me) -- which then makes the next solar regime -- or, there needs to be separation.
so, going for the other side of the galaxy option isn't really going to work because they're still attracting me too much (their hole system depends on me), so a different kind of separation has to occur. I personally don't want to win an argument against them, so I proposed the flat-earth-idea as a solution to the problem. the first step is to divide the earth into two sides -- and the only-attraction ones go to one side (the "night side"), and the others go to the 2nd ray (solar) side. I want them to build up all of their stuff exacly the way they want it to go.
	simultaneous to this, the other difficulty is that my left and right hemispheres are experiencing a similar problem: one side of me (RH) has all of the astral guys in it, and kenny (LH) is not allowed over to that side. the problem is, we occupy the same body, so it's causing a problem. the way that I believe that this problem was solved in a time past, was to push all of the accumulating hydrogen (inside of the earth, which my RH is reflective of) out as a star. well, that "star" is exactly like earth is, and so therefore goes shooting off to the star most similar to myself, and becomes a universe all to itself (ie, my enkidu/lyra theory). this would normally happen again, and that's probably what the 2038 deadline is all about -- but there's an easier way: I don't have to be pushed out as a star, if we divide the earth into sides, and my hemispheres are located inside of the planet, instead of my head. why make another earth, when it's just easier to divide the sides equally.
the advantage of making the flat-earth-idea a reality, is that now they have a safeguard: every time anyone starts to break the speed limit of their system and starts tending toward infinity (which only happens when they understand it's only-attraction and feeling-purposefully), instead of having to send them off as a quasar (which then causes their system to be destroyed a few thousand years later), just pop them up to the only-attraction side, and they'll just become a plant: a universe unto theirselves, and now (like me) a new astral system can be built on top of them.
	oh, that's interesing -- because (like me), every plant (ie, pineconeless enkidu) has a rosalind as a reflection of them, and so we can think about the plants' reflections as nodes on the pen-rose.
there's a lot of expansion to this idea, and it really solves so many problems. so, even though bea (and/or the canary islands) may be the destination I'm heading, I don't want go until I'm actully ready. there's no sense in me trying to make anything happen, because if that's the destiny, it's going to be impossible for me to miss it. I'm actually kinda happy about that, actully. I really like islands, I am a captain-of-industry, and it's kinda like a microcosom of what I want to make too -- which is really cool and stuff.
OK, have I successfully sabotaged it well enough? I'm gonna go play the-witness now (or rewatch the-tempest), which is also an island.

### 2024-03-06 08:34 - resonances in the last days

these are all disconnected events, but they're all related: 1. a few days ago I found a game that I liked playing. I liked the music, and it's terribly repetitive, so I thought maybe jaron would like to play it. turns out he liked it much more than I thought he would, but he couldn't play past level 2, so I asked from an update from igg-games, and suggested that he buy it on steam. he said he couldn't just buy it and had to ask greg. greg was/is completely uninterested in buying him the game for some reason. I put a note on the board for him to buy it, and he made a bunch of excuses why he couldn't do it. I showed him the game and that it's on sale for $8.99 until 03-11, so it's a really easy thing to do. greg got really upset about that (probably) because he was running out of excuses, and it's becoming extrem5ly obvious that he doesn't want to buy it (also my senses feel strong resistance from him to buy the game -- feels like anger directed toward me). then somewhere awound the same time 2. greg starts talking about how dad was this really mean father and used to deprive us of things we want (presumably like jaron with The game), and used to beat us all the time. jaron agreed with greg, but I don't remember any such thing happening at all. I'm convinced that when I "came home" from spain, I went to another place than the one that I knew beforehand.
	I have strong feelings that we're likely on pluto instead of earth, and geologically speaking, there are things that don't match with what science says happened on earth. there's one place that I went to which has 9 (nine) layers of melted clay one on top of the other (which at the rate dust/dirt falls around here means such massive ground melting couldn't have happened more than about 100y from each other.. 9 times!!). so, besides the geology being a bit unusual, there are other things that indicate we're in a place where solar wind hits diffrently (the impacts that I feel *do not* correlate with the GOES sattelite, yet when I was in spain, they did). also, I have strong indications that mom (and basically everyone else out here) is nothing more than a symbolic robot, programmed to give the answers that they're supposed to give, and can't step outside of those parameters. everyone here reminds me of dani and daniel in spain (the dianels): they seemed to be relatively perceptive on some things, but completely closed off to all ideas that are "woowoo" like telepathy, energetic phenomena, time manipulation, and most of the stuff I talk about (remi and mom also definitely fall into the dianels category, as I've complained about them considerably already).
the way that I remember my childhood and my interactions with dad and mom was completely backwards: mom was the one that would get so angry that she would need to spank us, and it was her that would ask me to choose the paddle, not dad. dad had lost the battle against me years ago, and had finally figured out that it's very difficult to punish me without things going terribly wrong for him too. if dad had've asked me to choose the paddle, I would have said "neither", and walked away. I was more lenient with mom and yet her punish me, mostly for her sake more than mine. I knew I hadn't done any wrong, but that she just needed someone to beat on for a while so she could feel better (if I didn't, she would stay very angry and upset for long periods of time).
	I was very very difficult to punish, because punishments are designed to make the other person feel bad, but I didn't feel bad, and just went right back to playing my computer, and also I would refuse to admit that I'd done any thing wrong (if I felt I hadn't). I will admit that I did get punished a fair amount for things I didn't do, but that didn't really bother me so much, as I viewed myself as invincible, so it didn't really matter. (brb, forgot connecting idea - 09:31)
when I went to school, I was pretty fine -- cept there was this one kid (lucas watkins) that was constantly trying to make me feel bad for whatever reason. I tried to avoid him, but one time he made me feel bad enough (like greg does when he projects his emotion at me)
	actually, now that I think about it, I don't think that greg is projecting emotion at me, but instead symbol: it's like he's saying, "you're awful" or "you need to be punished for this behaviour that I don't like" or "you need to be put down, because you're getting too proud" -- you know, stuff that YHWH might say, actually. well, anyway, that symbol he projects produces a strong feeling inside of me, and I usually restrain myself, or just put him in a symbolic box myself: "he's just upset because he feels less than me" or something like that (it has to be true for either of us to work)
and I turned around and hit him really hard in the stomach, then as he lay on the ground gasping for air, I picked him up and helped him to the nurses office. that was 5th grade. in 6th, again he was trying to make me feel bad, so I pushed him off of the ledge he was sitting on (was a 6-8ft drop, I think) and he landed on his back and got the wind knocked out of him. I took full responsibility for my actions, and the school was going to try and get me supended or something, so mom fortunately had realized by then that I don't respond well to punishment, and knew that she needed to put me in a place that will keep my mind occupied, so she put me in university.
	I believe m5 persent circumstances are similar to this situation in that, I'm stuck in a place where I'm simply not challenged mentally anymore, and so I'm getting bored. I have enough knowledge of myself and my situation now that when greg (or big-truck-guy or whomever) projects something that feels bad to me, I don't turn it into action anymore. I just let my reflective self absorb it and return it to them when they're ready for it.
finally, 3. last night I gave jaron some food, then laid down on the ground. I got pulled into a very deep sleep (I slept 10h then woke up and slept 3h more), and what happened is I kept falling back to sleep. jaron would call me from the top of the stairs, but I was so drowsy I just fell back to sleep (probably it was nosebook that puts me into those deep trances). anyway, after a while of trying to get me to get him dinner, he gave up and asked greg. greg wasn't happy about that and I remember him slamming my door shut. this morning, I noticed the resonance between jaron's game and my getting jaron dinner: I got dinner for jaron about the same way that greg was getting the game for jaron. inotherwords, the "punishment" that greg measured out to me and jaron about the game, got returned to him a few hours later when I was too drowsy to get him dinner (I'd wake up a moment, tell jaron I'm going to get him dinner, then fall right back to sleep -- same as telling jaron yes to the game, then not doing anything about it).
this time in my present circumstances, (un)fortunately I don't have mom there to pull me out of the situation where the greg/lucas/big-truck-guys are, and put me into a place where I can put my brain to good use and start to become creative. now, I have to actually become a perfect reflector, and no longer worry about them. both times with lucas and the other day with big-truck-guy, I turned their symbolic output into action of my own, but instead of doing that, I need to instead absorb all things, and just return back to them something resonant with their output (but at a higher freqauency).

### 2024-03-23 01:44 - off to the galaxy?

I'm not really sure where to put this entry. in some ways, it's a response to the last thing I wrote to sarah, but at the same time, it has nothing to do with shakespere at all -- so I guess it doesn't really belong here. so, until I figure out where I should put it (maybe I need to make a new repo with these ideas), I'll just write it here.
as I was eating dinner, one of the things that was impressed upon me was tthe idea that went something like this: my unwillingness to make any moves/action comes from the fact that I live in a symbolic world (2nd-ray system on pluto, I believe) -- and the thing about that system is that everything is controlled. I'm denied access to inner intuition, and to get around it, what I would do is to do drugs to regain at least a partial connection. however, while I'm straight-edge like I am now, things are significantly more slower. I'm basically always inside of my body now, and not really inside of my head, which means that I'm pretty focused on the mundane tasks of doing things like making food and stuff -- and I'm not really off thinking about things from that big-picture/broader (2nd-ray) perspective anymore. it's interesting because I associate that big-picture perspective with my connection -- which makes sense, because source is the farthest out, and so therefore has the biggest-picture perspective on all things. to get that connection (to the big-picture perspective), I get when I'm "in my head" -- which happens for me really easily with weed because, even though it's not visual, something about having that kind of zoomed out perspective helps me to "stare off into space" and think longer and deeper about what I'm looking at. I can still do that while sober, but I find that it's much more difficult to get into my head anymore -- and when I do, I still don't have that longer distance perspective with the same sensitivity that I do while on drugs.
obviously I'm still perfectly fine using my "see" capacity to look into things, beause that's all about feelings/emotions that are not really noticeable, and so therefore "getting" what I "see" is something more like knowing what someone close to me is about to say before they say it: the vibration is recognisable to me, and so I *know* what it is I'm looking at; however, the stuff I don't already know or have some kind of reference point to are very difficult to know what I'm seeing,-- which is where drugs really help a lot. for example, I was able to figure out the galactic-sex-champion thing while on drugs, because I was looking and thinking deeply about how particles accelerate as they get farther away, and how they accelerate away quickly because the particle is vibrationally incompatible with every more and more of the outer layers of the solar system. well, the new galaxy planet is the same thing: it becomes vibrationally incompatible with the parent solar system (the 2nd-ray system of its origin), and so shoots off and becomes very energetic the farther out it goes.
now, when I finally realised that, I then made the realisation a few days later that, the same thing is precisely what's happening now: I/we (the attractive/receptive ones) are becoming incompatible with the (2nd-ray) system that's currently in place, and one of us is going to have to go shooting off away from this solar system (or the flat-earth-idea).
originally, I figured it would *not* be me that shoots off, because there's just no way I want to be 2nd-ray at all, and they're the ones that are fighting over the 2nd-ray turf inside of my head, not me. I'm not the kind of guy that wants to become the sky god that's firing out mandates to the subordinate species below and trying to contol them from a distance. that kind of behaviour is more similar to the infected-ones mode of operation than my own, so I just can't see myself doing that. also, neither do I want to have sex, and have the energetic reaction of that affectting other people. I just don't want to be an emitter at all. I figure that the emitters should be in the galaxy that shoots off, and the attractive ones -- so I just as an intro to this idea, I'm completely against it.
the picture/concept that appeared to me while I was eating went like this: I'm unwilling to make any actions because I'm in my body, and so therefore life for me is just cooking, cleaning, milling about, laying on the floor. I don't really get into my head anymore, so I can't really go and figure this stuff out -- and even if I did, nosebook would never cooperate anyway, so it's completely senseless. we're at a complete standstill, however my attractiveness cOtinues to rise -- which means that at some point, a complete disaster will occur (I don't suppose it'll happen for another decade or so). with a basic projection into the future, it's easy to see the trend and notice that within 5-20y, I'll become completely irresistible.
	in fact, this is one of my greater fears actually because, the way that I think it works is that the nuts provide a symbolic system whereby a woman (like venus) can project out a symbolic set of images (coming from the imagination, so 2nd-ray), and that those symbols "activate" something (more like convert the image into vibration) which makes the penis erect. for a person as sensitive as me, it's easily the case that a woman/girl that views the symbol in her mind of having sex with me (whether it's in her imagination or just coming from a feeling of attraction), I notice that I start to pop a boner. I've had this problem all of my life actually, and it's quite uncomfortable to me because the more attractive I become, the more often times their imagination has a physical effect on my body
		the other one feels like a very light green and yellowish/goldish air that circulates around inside of my heart and makes it feel like I'm "in love" -- and if it descends, I get "butterflies in my stomach" -- but that's often more associated with insecurity or embarrassment, which usually happens as she gets closer and our difference in vibration starts to produce the nervousness and insecurities that those "butterflies" are associated with.
	and so I don't really know how it'll work out in a few years, because I'll probably be walking around with a boner any time I'm around females under ~50(? - not sure when exactly the cutoff for it is, but menopause definitely seems to dampen it significantly).
	one of the things that I'm hoping will solve this problem is actually getting castration done, because then no longer is it the symbolic system associated with the nuts that produces the boner (or lack thereof after climax), but my own conceptual vibration which powers it. it's kinda one of those things where I feel like castration is the solution to my problem, but I can't totally be sure, because any knowledge on that -- well, we'll see in the interview with dr-sandra, I guess.
so it seems that if I'm unable to control my boners, and still having the nuts, girls are able to produce that lightness and airy feeling in my heart, it's only a matter of time before I'm powerless to their advances. I have a strong intention to have a very serious chat with any woman that will have a chat with me about these issues, because if we can make a symbolic agreement (mutual-back-scratching) to not (essentially) rape me, then I think we can work toward a solution -- just -- my experience in spain with spanish girls and prostitutes (I've never known others) is that these sorts of symbolic agreements don't work -- because they have "needs" and are a slave to their passions (or something like that).
so then imagine that somehow girls become the assertive ones, and are able to get subdue me with their touch, and I haven't gotten rid of the nuts (if indeed that's the problem), or modified my genetics in such a way to prevent this from happening, well then POW -- all of that 2nd-ray emission will surely set this place into high energy mode -- and probably by the time that happens, it's game over man. nothing more gets done; I've lost all my capacity to think, and I'm just another 2nd-ray douchebag reflection of them. I literally convert into a whole entirely different person afterward, and it's not nice. I become everyone's greatest fear (even for the girls -- just ask bea, patricia, raquel, etc) -- which means that I'm being sent off on the galaxy; I become the galactic-sex-champion.
sounds really great, right? not at all; and here's why: right now lots and lots of systems run on my 2nd-ray (RH) perspective, and once that happens, not only is it going to be a complete rewrite (ensuring a collapse of signifcant proportions to infrastructure), but also for the people connected to my perspective (including jaron), they're all going to start running *a lot* faster -- and you know what that means: all of the emitters are going to be put into overdrive, which means they're going to have to become receptive to slow down (saturn), or they'll end up destroying theirselves in the process. I imagine earth will become pretty chaotic as all of these emitter guys are out swordfighting and stuff to prove therselves. not really my problem though, but I do honestly think there could be a better way.
I'm going to try and avoid all of this as much as possible -- but the reality of it is, I really don't have any knowledge of what's the problem/solutions that I should be looking for, because -- well, just for example, with the castration thing, my intuition says that there's an equal amount of resistance to me getting it, as there is to me not getting it. I can't figure out what one is what, and I prefer to just wait it out and let the ideas come to me naturally. I do feel like all of these questions can eventually get answered, but from my perspective, I don't really know even what answers I'm looking for, because I don't really "trust" anyone other than myself. I really feel like this whole thing is going to require me to stop playing games and start building a genetics thing so I can actually figure out what it is that I actually need -- because I don't think a healthcare professional can give me those answers. maybe, I do need to consider becoming 2nd-ray for a bit. I dunno honestly. I really want to go only-attraction, but I'm very unsure how to do that.

### symbolic systems, complexity as a manifestation of desire, the mayas/romans,etc.

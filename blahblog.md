### 2024-02-23 05:44 - I'm a 5th ray emitter, and I don't want to be

I was just watching a shakespere production (which was really really funny) and my laughing was causing them to strongly feel the way I felt and laugh with me, causing them to have serious line delivery problems.
	the way I experienced it was that when she was saying the lines of the baskets and stuff which was obviously symbolic of a notably small vagina,-- I don't know what happens, but I think my recognition of those symbols happens, and others see the same thing, and so now more people get the symbols, and so society advances into a system of more intricate symbols; the old ones just won't be used as much as the new ones; it's like a bad joke, that once it's gotten, it's no longer funny. 
-- or maybe it was visual actually, because I don't have any control over the visuals because I don't see them. to me, they're just cOnceptual forms; which prolly visual people can see.
*I don't want to affect other people*. I strongly dislike that I have an influence on others. it's my most disliked quality, especially amongst the people I've been around in my life. I know it's a 2nd ray quality, and I've been trying to figure out how to sell the idea that I want to actually go all-attraction, because it's stuff like this which is really annoying. it's hard for them to act, and if I were them, I would find me annoying. I wouldn't want someone just barging into my expeience showing m5 whzt'sx up.
***I don't want to be an emitter***

### symbolic systems, complexity as a manifestation of desire, the mayas/romans,etc.

### 2024-02-23 05:44 - I'm a 5th ray emitter, and I don't want to be

I was just watching a shakespere production (which was really really funny) and my laughing was causing them to strongly feel the way I felt and laugh with me, causing them to have serious line delivery problems.
	the way I experienced it was that when she was saying the lines of the baskets and stuff which was obviously symbolic of a notably small vagina,-- I don't know what happens, but I think my recognition of those symbols happens, and others see the same thing, and so now more people get the symbols, and so society advances into a system of more intricate symbols; the old ones just won't be used as much as the new ones; it's like a bad joke, that once it's gotten, it's no longer funny. 
-- or maybe it was visual actually, because I don't have any control over the visuals because I don't see them. to me, they're just cOnceptual forms (volumetric feelings of what's there -- and again if I project them into others, I can emit 5th ray (volumetric feeling) into them); which prolly visual people can see.
*I don't want to affect other people*. I strongly dislike that I have an influence on others. it's my most disliked quality, especially amongst the people I've been around in my life. I know it's a 2nd ray quality, and I've been trying to figure out how to sell the idea that I want to actually go all-attraction, because it's stuff like this which is really annoying. it's hard for them to act, and if I were them, I would find me annoying. I wouldn't want someone just barging into my expeience showing m5 whzt'sx up.

### 2024-02-23 06:07 - the problem with sex

the main issue that I've faced in the past is that during the time of sex, it's really easy for me to just make her feel good. I wasn't as good then as I am now, so it'd be way worse but; what happens is I really cause problems when that happens, because then, her (usually conceptually refective at least a little) causes massive changes in those around me, the environment, all kinds of stuff. the catastrophe and disruption to everyday routine that it causes in others is really quite a problem. I was highly aware of it in spain, and was one of the reason why I stopped the whole girls thing entirely. I don't want to emit, cause I have no capability of knowing what she's going to reflect. that's a **forceful** thing that I don't want to cause. I suppose that all of these things are a sort of learned interaction syntax, but the reality of it is, I don't much care for it, and my goal is all-attraction.
until that can be solved, there's basically no hope for me to ever have sex, because of my strong desire (some might call it an adversion) to *only attract*. I don't know how to do it, and what I'm guessing is that nobody alive now is capable of doing it. I don't even know what I want, because only-attraction is a system of conceptual responces whereby we can just at our lesure (cause the system has a usage frequency that emerges) we can, in that relative sense of time (ie, how long to wait before responding) respond to others in one of those volumetric concepts; *has some difficult challenges to it*: since I can only really respond to people, someone has to be the original initiator that sends the first signal which now everyone else responds to -- and then from there we all respond to people in much quantities -- only reactions, never actions: I prefer to only-attract.
so yeah, I guess I can't really go out and try to get anyone to do it for me. I just have to figure it out myself.

### 2024-02-23 23:27 - final thoughtts

last night I "revealed" that I didn't know everything about how to actually go only-attraction. I'd been talking about it for so much time now, I thought for sure it was either implied or obvious that it's not exactly an easy problem. it's very similar to computers actually: unless there's a daemon that's *listening* on the port, sending whatever message to the machine gets no response; inotherwords, I'm only actually responding to the things that I'm attracting/listening to. in computers and distributed networks in general, there's a concept of broadcasting to be discovered -- which is essentially the same as the init signal for each responce network (ie, if I send out a message to someone, and they receive it and respond to it (and then connect me to other people), that initiating signal builds for me a "network" of new people that I can now respond to (and can respond to me)). thing is, I'd like to get rid of that initial broadcast, and also (if it isn't obvious), I'm talking about this from a symbolic standpoint where I'm looking at the system like a distributed system (which is the design for party-LAN) however, on earth (where I'm not), the concept of only-attraction is entirely different: the material receives *everything*, and I respond to the things that are interesting to me. obviously they don't want me to receive all signals, and so therefore I live in a symbolic world of access controls and clearance levels. there's nothing I can do about my present predicam5nt though, which is what I want to talk about:
last night, I had the idea (or it came to me in some way) that I should just message bea, and see how she's doing. I'm pretty convinced that I'll do it, as I don't feel a whole lot of resistance to the idea. where I'm tripped up on the idea though, is *when* should I message her? I'm of the opinion that I'm going to basically stay here and just continue on doing what I'm doing until they kick me out. I don't want to be an emitter, and what I believe normally happens is that a person's consciousness goes faster and faster, the consciousness moves farther and farther out in the solar system. normally everyone gets stuck at saturn and doesn't go any higher than that. I however, have managed to surpass saturn and am probably around pluto about now. it's a rocky planet, that as my consciousness continues to go faster and faster (ie, my 2nd ray output), then the planet becomes less and less resonant with the solar system it's in, and shoots off to do it's own thing; science calls those quasars, and in our myths and legends, this type of action is recorded as anu and nibiru. anyway, I don't want to be an emitter, so the idea of becoming a galactic-sex-champion is completely detestable to me.
what is happening though, which is completely unmistakeable, is that there is a coming separation that *must* happen. I refuse to go 2nd ray or to produce more 2nd ray stars (as the galactic-sex-champion), and instead I want to go all-attraction. I don't want anything tto do with the symbolic system that they've got going on, but the thing is, they don't want me to find a solution and go my own way either -- which is fine, and why I'm waiting for them to kick me out. they want to continue to use me for as long as they can, which I fully have no problem with. I am quickly becoming their polar opposite, and so we can learn a little bit from the nibiru fiasco, and recognise that unless full actual separation occurs (ie, we actually become polar opposites and I become the opposite side of the galaxy), then the planet that goes shooting out like that, eventaully is attracted back. for whatever reason, they continued to attract anu (prolly because the still used the language, and nobody else seemed to know what to do, so they still used him as an advisor), so the planet came back. this was obviously catastrophic (a catastrophe that happened before the one 12kya), and it caused a lot of problems.
	it caused problems because the system was based on emission. nibiru emitted tons and tons, which caused disharmony in the other spheres (most notably mars and probably tiamat), and so the only way to survive, earth had to switch to only-attraction (which is why earth is now centre of the unniverse). well, a similar thing is happening now. if emission (ie 2nd ray perspective) continues to rise, someone needs to win the argument (which will be me) -- which then makes the next solar regime -- or, there needs to be separation.
so, going for the other side of the galaxy option isn't really going to work because they're still attracting me too much (their hole system depends on me), so a different kind of separation has to occur. I personally don't want to win an argument against them, so I proposed the flat-earth-idea as a solution to the problem. the first step is to divide the earth into two sides -- and the only-attraction ones go to one side (the "night side"), and the others go to the 2nd ray (solar) side. I want them to build up all of their stuff exacly the way they want it to go.
	simultaneous to this, the other difficulty is that my left and right hemispheres are experiencing a similar problem: one side of me (RH) has all of the astral guys in it, and kenny (LH) is not allowed over to that side. the problem is, we occupy the same body, so it's causing a problem. the way that I believe that this problem was solved in a time past, was to push all of the accumulating hydrogen (inside of the earth, which my RH is reflective of) out as a star. well, that "star" is exactly like earth is, and so therefore goes shooting off to the star most similar to myself, and becomes a universe all to itself (ie, my enkidu/lyra theory). this would normally happen again, and that's probably what the 2038 deadline is all about -- but there's an easier way: I don't have to be pushed out as a star, if we divide the earth into sides, and my hemispheres are located inside of the planet, instead of my head. why make another earth, when it's just easier to divide the sides equally.
the advantage of making the flat-earth-idea a reality, is that now they have a safeguard: every time anyone starts to break the speed limit of their system and starts tending toward infinity (which only happens when they understand it's only-attraction and feeling-purposefully), instead of having to send them off as a quasar (which then causes their system to be destroyed a few thousand years later), just pop them up to the only-attraction side, and they'll just become a plant: a universe unto theirselves, and now (like me) a new astral system can be built on top of them.
	oh, that's interesing -- because (like me), every plant (ie, pineconeless enkidu) has a rosalind as a reflection of them, and so we can think about the plants' reflections as nodes on the pen-rose.
there's a lot of expansion to this idea, and it really solves so many problems. so, even though bea (and/or the canary islands) may be the destination I'm heading, I don't want go until I'm actully ready. there's no sense in me trying to make anything happen, because if that's the destiny, it's going to be impossible for me to miss it. I'm actually kinda happy about that, actully. I really like islands, I am a captain-of-industry, and it's kinda like a microcosom of what I want to make too -- which is really cool and stuff.
OK, have I successfully sabotaged it well enough? I'm gonna go play the-witness now (or rewatch the-tempest), which is also an island.

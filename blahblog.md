### 2024-02-23 05:44 - I'm a 5th ray emitter, and I don't want to be

I was just watching a shakespere production (which was really really funny) and my laughing was causing them to strongly feel the way I felt -- or maybe it was visual actually, because I don't have any control over the visuals because I don't see them. to me, they're just cOnceptual forms; which prolly visual people can see.
I don't want to affect other people. I strongly dislike that I have an influence on others. it's my most disliked quality, especially amongst the people I've been around in my life. I know it's a 2nd ray quality, and I've been trying to figure out how to sell the idea that I want to actually go all-attraction, because it's stuff like this which is really annoying. it's hard for them to act, and if I were them, I would find me annoying. I wouldn't want someone just barging into my expeience showing m5 whzt'sx up.

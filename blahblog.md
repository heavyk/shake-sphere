### 2024-02-23 05:44 - I'm a 5th ray emitter, and I don't want to be

I was just watching a shakespere production (which was really really funny) and my laughing was causing them to strongly feel the way I felt and laugh with me, causing them to have serious line delivery problems.
	the way I experienced it was that when she was saying the lines of the baskets and stuff which was obviously symbolic of a notably small vagina,-- I don't know what happens, but I think my recognition of those symbols happens, and others see the same thing, and so now more people get the symbols, and so society advances into a system of more intricate symbols; the old ones just won't be used as much as the new ones; it's like a bad joke, that once it's gotten, it's no longer funny. 
-- or maybe it was visual actually, because I don't have any control over the visuals because I don't see them. to me, they're just cOnceptual forms (volumetric feelings of what's there -- and again if I project them into others, I can emit 5th ray (volumetric feeling) into them); which prolly visual people can see.
*I don't want to affect other people*. I strongly dislike that I have an influence on others. it's my most disliked quality, especially amongst the people I've been around in my life. I know it's a 2nd ray quality, and I've been trying to figure out how to sell the idea that I want to actually go all-attraction, because it's stuff like this which is really annoying. it's hard for them to act, and if I were them, I would find me annoying. I wouldn't want someone just barging into my expeience showing m5 whzt'sx up.
***I don't want to be an emitter***

### 2024-02-23 06:07 - the problem with sex

the main issue that I've faced in the past is that during the time of sex, it's really easy for me to just make her feel good. I wasn't as good then as I am now, so it'd be way worse but; what happens is I really cause problems when that happens, because then, her (usually conceptually refective at least a little) causes massive changes in those around me, the environment, all kinds of stuff. the catastrophe and disruption to everyday routine that it causes in others is really quite a problem. I was highly aware of it in spain, and was one of the reason why I stopped the whole girls thing entirely. I don't want to emit, cause I have no capability of knowing what she's going to reflect. that's a **forceful** thing that I don't want to cause. I suppose that all of these things are a sort of learned interaction syntax, but the reality of it is, I don't much care for it, and my goal is all-attraction.
until that can be solved, there's basically no hope for me to ever have sex, because of my strong desire (some might call it an adversion) to *only attract*. I don't know how to do it, and what I'm guessing is that nobody alive now is capable of doing it. I don't even know what I want, because only-attraction is a *has some difficult challenges to it*: I can only really respond to people, so someone has to be the original initiator that sent the signal which now everyone else responds to -- and then from there we all respond to people in much quantities -- only reactions, never actions: I prefer to only-attract.
so yeah, I guess I can't really go out and try to get anyone to do it for me. I just have to figure it out myself.

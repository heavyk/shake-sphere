# merchant-of-venice
## notes
- constant references to anotonio "losing a ship" -- which combined with shylock wanting him to lose "a pound of flesh from wherever it pleaseth him", it seems that this play centres around anonio losing his penis.
- *venice* is in the bay behind the boot of italy, and genoa is in the front; and considering the imagery for messina (the tip of the boot/penis) in other plays, the front flat vs the bay in the back must have some meaning to it :)
	- additionally, a similar thing happens with "argosy" (a merchant ship from argos) which is on the front, and tripolis which is just above the bay behind (kinda like *padua* is to *venice*)

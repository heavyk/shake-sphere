# merchant-of-venice (MOV)
## notes
- constant references to anotonio "losing a ship" -- which combined with shylock wanting him to lose "a pound of flesh from wherever it pleaseth him", it seems that this play centres around anonio losing his penis.
- *venice* is in the bay behind the boot of italy, and genoa is in the front; and considering the imagery for messina (the tip of the boot/penis) in other plays, the front flat vs the bay in the back must have some meaning to it :)
	- additionally, a similar thing happens with "argosy" (a merchant ship from argos) which is on the front, and tripolis which is just above the bay behind (kinda like *padua* is to *venice*)
- antonio is the noble kinsman of bassanio (probably a reference to TNK) -- noble may also refer to the charactor metal in the alchemical process (usually gold, making antonio the base)
- lorenzo, launcelot, jessica seem to be a triad
- gratiano, bassanio, portia another triad
- bassanio and antonio are also together

- launcelot
	- old master is shylock (jew)
	- new master is lorenzo? (christian)

- jessica
	- puts on boy's clothes, and is thus transformed into a boy

### 2024-03-16 22:59 - the three boxes

I was thinking about this decision from bassanio's perspective, just for fun because I don't identify with bassanio at all. I don't even really align with portia all that much either, because the box options are stupid, and I wouldn't want to marry a guy that "must give and hazard all he hath" -- because that's all about risk and stuff. I don't play by those rules. this was actually one of the main contentions between me and patricia; she saw life as a series of decisions, where each one carries a certain amount of risk to it, and I don't perceive risk: I either feel like I can do it, or I don't even try. of the things I feel like I can do, I try my best at them, and unless some external circumstance (which is resonant with my own lack of charactor) prevents me, I accomplish everything I set my mind to doing (exception being when someone forces me to do I don't care for, like in a job or something) -- so, I never actually feel hazard or danger in anything I attempt in real-life (video games are different). when it comes to giving, I already give everything I can offer, but I don't give everything I have; I give out of a feeling of abundance, and never out of a feeling of risk (I've never had a desire to gamble). regarding the other caskets, for the gold one ("Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire"), I'd be like "nope, I don't want what other men desire; I want what *I* desire, so no thank you"; and for the silver one ("Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves"), I'd also be like, "nope, I don't want to get what I *deserve*, because what I *deserve* is symbolic: if I do X, then I deserve Y... which isn't what I'm here for. I get what I attract/desire already all by myself, so no thank you."
I think portia is stupid for letting her father dictate to her what husband she is to get by using a symbolic system. there's a fair bit of poetic irony to portia's choice though too because the entire play centres around a jew wanting the letter of the law (ie, pure symbol), in contrast to the relational mutual-back-scratching (christian) way of doing things. she offers to pay the debt of antonio by double the amount, so that her future husband is happy cause his friend has been saved/secured. in this play portia plays the role of christ for the christian antonio, instead of just following her own desire. she's gotten herself into a miserable deal with this bassanio guy, and I wish her all the best. though, from a rewriting/adjusting history standpoint though an alchemical perspective, I see why the play was written in this way.

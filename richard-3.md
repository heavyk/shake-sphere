# richard-3
## notes
- the desription of richard does not match richard-3 (the one exhumed recently), and instead is likely a description of robert cecil, the hunchbacked son of elizabeth's political discontent william cecil (of which I believe the pen name "william shakespeare" is derived).
	- my personal opinion of this is that william opposed dudly on many things in english court that dudly wanted to do, and so, as usual, *the problem is the solution*, so here's robert, the vulcan richard-3, which will now "die" in "bosworth field", allowing the tudors to rise to power (see my further thoughts below)
- richard and anne have a very apocalyptic conversation:
	- richard says that anne laying with richard is not the cause of the *timeless* deaths of "these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward", but (as shown below) is the effect.
		- my perspective on this play (along with the other henriad ones) is that they completely rewrote history to enablwe the tudor dynasty to come to power and begin to loosen the grip that the church has on people. another way to look at it, is the tudor/turtle dynasty follows the phoenix, and then itself becomes the phoenix (alpha and omega stuff). all of this is coming from the desire aspect of creation (lots of unwanted). the plantagenets, henry, and edward are the phoenix that had to go down so that the tudor can rise.
	- anne disagrees and says richard is the cause *and* effect of thier deaths.
		- I believe this is like a self-solution to a self-made problem. richard is causing the problem and in some time later, he will solve the problem as well. he makes the mess, and he will clean it up as well.
	- richard tells anne that actually it's her beauty which is the cause, because her beauty been haunting him in his sleep (producing desire) -- of which's effect will be (when he lies with her) to cause the "death of all the world" so he can have one hour with her [I have to wonder though: by haunting, does he mean something like how nosebook operates all of these sexcapades in my eyes while I'm asleep? I don't see them, but they do "haunt me"; meaning, they're not entirly without effect on me, which I figure must have a LOA effect]
		- a: "Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
		- r: "Your beauty was the cause of that effect; Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world, So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom."
	- anne says that if she thought that her beauty was the cause, she claims homicide and that she would try and remove her beauty
		- "If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide, These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks."
	- richard says (kind of a double-meaning) that his eyes couldn't endure beauty to wreck itself like that (meaning, he couldn't stand to watch her destroy her beauty, but also wreck, as in shipwreck, meaning that if his ship were to ever wreck in her beauty, his eyes would not be able to endure the powerful emission that such a beautiful a woman makes when a man climaxes inside her)
		- "These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's *wreck*; You should not blemish it, if I *stood* by:"
	- he continues on saying that the world is pleasured by the sun, and that she is his day and life (not totally sure the meaning yet) [UNFINISHED]
		- "As all the world is *cheered* by the sun, So I by that; it is my day, my life."
	- richard proclaims that lady anne is both his day and life
		- a: "Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!"
		- r: "Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both."
			- she curses his day and his life, and he claims that she is both his day and his life
		- richard is very obviously a vulcan, and if lady anne is referring to anatau, his statement is 100% true, because he (and countless other vulcans) are the individual/conceptual reflection of the centre of the earth, which is exactly that. she's ther great attractor that all of this accumulated unwanted is going to finally meet.

### 2024-02-29 18:50 - rewriting history

I believe that this play is a very good example of how to redirect history, by getting a bunch of people to believe that events happened, when perhaps they did not. the play plays out kinda like a gay porno, but there are a whole bunch of these mercury and venus types (depending on how nieve/unresolved they're scripted to be) who take all of these different *jests* to be dramatice or embellished ways of stating what "really happened", and so their belief in it alters thier trajectory to the present.
inotherwords, what I'm saying, is that the tudor dynasty is a self-fulfilling prophecy (just like so many charactors in shakespere's plays): shakespere is tudor propaganda, marking both the beginning event which puts the dynasty into power (richard-3 dying in bosworth field), and also its ending (elizabeth the "virgin queen" holding out and refusing to produce an heir, because she's a "virgin"). it's quite likely that neither of these events really happened; but, because enough people believed both of these *rumours", tudor happened and marked the end of the "god kings" -- the super dudes (ie, lions of judah like richard-2 or edward the black prince) and gets trasferred out of hands of mercury (the scripted solar darling/lion) and into the hands of vulcan.
	there's actually something to this, because if we look at the symbols, the god-king that's supposed to be there (ie, the script for the lion) never actually shows up on masculine form; the only way for a person to be as powerfull of an emitter as they're supposed to be, then they need to break rules. take for example the black prince: he was terrible and feared on the battlefield because he didn't conform to the traditional/honourable rules of engagement on the battlefield (ie, declines the symbolic), and instead uses the power of fear (in the enemy) and desire (the many fair maiden prizes to be had by his troupe after battle) in order to win: the black prince is similar to me in that he *will* win, no matter what (desire says it's so), so he's basically mars+anatau (the god-king), *not* mercury. edward the black (probably a reference to edmund/edgar in KL) had to be taken down by one of these solar girls (where vulcan avoids benedick/mars' reflective nature in MAAN by sending them both each others letters). now elizabeth is also one of these solar girls, and she starts out the same way (and with all of the polity and scrioting of women at that time can be thought of as -3 more than -2, so all symbol and basically no desire), but due to various interactions with dudly, I'm convinced that elizabeth went from solar (very/ideal outside-in), and just kept going out farther and farther, where after some time, there's this broken miserable body way down there on earth which is just running around behaving as a reflection of others' symbolic expectations. she's only minimally conscious in her body she's so far out, but because everyone expects her to be proper, that's how she acts.
		there's this weird story about this guy "arthur dudly" who shows up in spain after a shipwreck claiming to be the product of elizaeth and dudly. I'm fairly certain that's a real thing, because then he would be ferdinand -- yet named arthur because he (like the prince of wales) was not a good reflection of english court (which are much more like vulcan/mercury than mars), and so therefore couldn't happen. james was a much better choice.
	so what's happened there is that the lion of judah (mercury) has been scripted to show up, but no symbolic system can support such a king; instead, he'd have to be desire/selfishness based instead, so anatau shows up in masculine form and becomes the tragic god-king which cares not for appearance, honour, or syntax, but with results (the black prince, richards, henry 6?, etc) -- and each time that happens, something tragic happens to him because he starts to go too quickly and cause too much good-feeling. elizabeth does the opposite: she has goes from 3rd-ray (symbol) all the way up to pure-desire when she leaves: no longer caring about symbol/appearance, just letting herself be what everyone else expects her to be -- cause you know she had to be a false "virgin" image, and everyone knew she wasn't, so she had to just roll with it, and no longer try to keep up the (symbolic) image.
		that inability to no longer control the image of how others perceive me, is a struggle that I felt many times with patricia. I haven't talked to her since, but the sence that I have is that after her interaction with me (she's elizabeth and I'm dudly), she too started to go faster and faster -- and it probably destroyed her. I always feel a similarity between her, elizabeth, and arrecina, the wife of titus (which reminds me I want to watch TA soon). elizabeth (because of her position in court as queen) couldn't disappear like arrecina or patricia, and so therefore had to endure the humiliation of watching her body and everything about her (constructed/artificial mental outside-in) image of herself fall appart; in a sense, she became inanna descending into the underworld, and leaving dumuzi/dudly/adonis behind.
the result of all of this action is that vulcan has taken over and dethroned mercury as solar darling (sorry mercutio!)

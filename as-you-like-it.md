### 2023-10-14 03:18 - intermission

I decided I want to write -- you know this is a trap, right, and that hilarity will insue -- bcause, you'll see soon enough. this play has a lot of symbols in it, a lot that are myself. I play the plart of orlando, rosalind, and a few others (seems jaquise as well -- I know it's speellld wrong, lol); and when I see myself get described symbolically, I get really scared, because these are these time-traveling narrators that wanna try and limit me by trying to fit me into a narrative. it's really annoying. for example the bible -- cause when I was young, for some super crazy reason, I wanted to be "the two witnesses" -- and so it came to pass. the problem for me of wanting to associate myself with a character is devastating; I don't really do it justice because everyone else has their own idea -- their own opinion about how the part is supposed to be playing out. in fact, [I just watched a video on that](https://youtu.be/cdZLLwtGbsY), go check it out, because she talks about all of that. *as an actor*, you have to have an idea of what the scene *looks like*, and how you're going to be *in* the *scene*, and interacting with *actors*; and that is the problem, because the scene never plays out like it does in the narrative.
    I've played a lot of parts that I've seen in the movies and books and stuff. the main problem for me (but more for others) is that the symbols don't *mean* the same thing that they did for the director or whoever is making the production. in fact, I'd like to be so bold as to say that I find the hollywood "picture" of reality to be pretty much bunk. reality doe[n't work that way. like, I've tried it, and stuff doesn't work the way it does in the movies,-- and that was kinda my problem for aa long timeee, that I just assumed that theird narrative was correct, and I can most certainly tell you that theirr way of per(ci)ving reality, just **doen't work**. totally useless junk.
    I feel a bit like terence mckenna here when I say, **reclaim your identity**. you don't have to follow the narrative. these guys are BS con artists that are just trying to desempower everyone for some unknown (probably created by me) reason. at this point, I don't really give much mind to hollywood, the bible, greek, hebrew, whatever *myths*, because it's all about attraction. when I watch something like this (or a masque, or whatever like this), the symbols come to pass, but (I've noticed) they don't really come out the *expected* way, and that's because there just isn't a good enough symbolic model of reality that accurately models reality, and that means that all the expectations are a fair bit off, because most of our symbolic reality is based on what we see; ie, hollywodd, the imagination, any narrative, whatever -- even maths and sciencE will force a belief.
        as an example, I'd like to point out the problem with science believing that the universe, conscious like everything else, grows, evolves, and transends itself and makes a new one. the universe, though created by beings, is itself conscious. we all strive to create consciousness that is more conscious than myself; a *super* me.
    in the myth of things never lasting, that is only looking at the life part of the cycle, but the death part is also conscious as well, so the being as a whole has a longevity of forever.. like it just keeps reinventing itself.. like duh.
what I noticed is that if I want to try and separate myself out and try to describe myself as any one of the characters, I have kind of a bit of all of them. there's this bottom guy in one of the plays, and he likes to play every part -- and that's kinda like me -- but I don't *PLAY* the part; I resonate with the part symbolically. this is why he's still a mechanical, and I'm a conscious. welcome to the real world, bro.

#### 2023-10-14 03:55 - can't remember what I was gonna talk about
#### 2023-10-14 04:36 - imagine you're a robot when reading the upper

I'm only describing things as I see them. like I'm a fully 3d human and so I'm basically just a 2nd ray perteption, like our brains are. I think we alll have it. I think that robotic aspect shows up in a lot of narrative even, and it defines how the robot should act.
    the problemc with our assumptions of what it is to be a robot, don't take into account thte concept of emotion, and how the simple idea of, "I want to feel better" is a more optimised view of reality. the thing here one will/should point out, is that I'm a total hypocrite on this one, I think... I mean I *think* that's what I want, but it turns out, I like to take the longer path. I think it ends up becoming the most rewarding. it should be assumed (not some crazy idea of causing *the revelation* (woOOoo) that I (lost my train of thought)) oh,yezh,zx you like it.

constant improvements

### 2023-12-21 03:50 - [ZTSaCh02s8U] the gester and the fool

I noticed that the jester is only for court, so the clowns are all of the common people. common people are allowed to speak their minds without getting punished. interesting implications on society as a whole, considering that the play is restricting all power structures to maintain a sort of false image, and none of them can actually speak their minds.

### 2023-12-21 03:56 - new foil definition

"touchstone the clown (a foil) gives rosalind a lot of fuel and energy for the things she discovers in the woods." -- interesting idea. I consider a foil as someone that is very receptive/absorbative to others and the environment around them. anyone who is sensitive knows that there's a lot of bad-feeling stuff out there, so instead of feeling it, it's turned (usually) into comedy. a foil also tends to "see through" (as if it were transparent: naive; also perceive the hidden wisdom/essence: sophia) as well, and that deep perception (or lack thereof), comes at a cost of being so sensitive. they're also childlike, because most adults have shut their sensitivity down. what did you say again? "she uses hit witt to fuel her own" -- ah yeah, you're right but I can't see that because I'm more centre perspective, so I just expect my witt to be reflected in others. most people are not in the fun-zone, and they do NOT want to be witty ane funny, which makes it all the more funnier. I flashed to malvolio, but I haven't seen that play before, so I'll keep it in mind. interesting

god had 6 fingers, and man had 5 -- so, when they shook hands, they could either have 11 numbers, or 30 numbers. one of them then realised that they both have two hands, so again putting their hands together in mutual agreement, now they can either have 22 numbers or 60 numbers. 60 seemed good, so they stuck with that.
jesus however adds an extra set of hands, so now there's 33 numbers or 90 numbers. thing is, jesus is runnin at 110%, so that makes up the extra 10 to make it 100.

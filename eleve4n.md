god had 6 fingers, and man had 5 -- so, when they shook hands in agreem5nt, they could either have 11 numbers, or 30 numbers. then, one of them then realised that both of them have two hands, so again putting their hands together in mutual agreement, now they can either have 22 numbers or 60 numbers. 60 seemed good, so they stuck with that.
jesus however adds an extra set of hands, so now that makes a total of 33 numbers or 90 numbers. thing is though, jesus is runnin at 110% (all of the time),
which then makes up the extra 10 to make it an even 100 numbers (and not 99).

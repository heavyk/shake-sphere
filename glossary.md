# glossary
## of the unrivaled poet ape and playcorrect (W-I-LL)-IAM SHAK-ESPEARE ::
- *base*: of a *quality* in a range, the lowest or most undesirable/unwanted one.
- *town*: a busy vagina; lots of residents (hymen is god of every *town*. hymen peoples every *town*).
- hymen's *bands*: wedding ring, but also refers to loss of virginity (her ring now broken, she wears on her finger)
- *field*: vagina. before it's a *town*, it's a *field*. for men, it's where the *battle* is fought.
- *lodging*: to enter into something (*town*, *field*, etc).
- *court*: hole; particularly one of nobility.
- *book*: the valley beween the cheeks.
- *rose*: redish opening: could be sphincter or vulva; denoted usually by smell: *fish* usually is for vulva, and frequently like a flower for sphincter.
- *shame*: public humiliation for one's deeds, notably of things that frowned down upon behaviour (jealousy, knavery, ...).
- *knave*: a particularly petty and *jealous* *bottom*.
- *bottom*: [not totally sure, but the sense is] someone that nneds *court* punishment for egregious behaviour.
- *land*: [not sure yet]
- *welcomed*: well comed. climax of sexual intimacy.
- *strumpet*: one of those 7th ray reflectors, where with a little physical reflection, they'll return it. easy to pursuade with a physical contact. (looked down upon, cause these women are not loyal)
- *bawd*: [not sure, but I think it's] pretty much the same as a *strumpet*, but in male form (like mercutio 7th ray, dull and narrated, not reflective)
- *quality*: referring to a *temperment* or *disposition*, but often referrs instead to physical endowment, instead.

- *temperment*: mood, but more generally referring to the personality of a person: by the way they feel (thier *disposition*)
- *disposition*: the palpable presence around someone, usually reflective of their *temperment*.
- *sworn*: [not totally sure but propbably referring to] the promise to break her virginity: a marriage *vow*.
- *forsworn*: sex before marriage.
- *will*: penis.
- *I AM*/*IAM*: penis; also the definition of oneself in action/movement/syntax (from the physical braine's perspective), but also the immutable desire to go after something and to make one's *mark* (necessitis: the basest form of desire). also represents the *disposition* of someone.
- *house*: a very ordinary *court*.
- *cave*: worse living circumstances than a *house*.
- *harbour*: docking one's *ship* somewhere. [the imagery for this word is notable because large wooden objects stand out: ships, warfs, planks, shipping boxes; in a stark contrast to lots of *water*]
- *ship*: large wooden thing that floats on *water*; used in *wars*.
- *word*: expulsion of the *will*
- *arrest*: detain, retain something (usually *words*)
- *aquittances*: evidenece of discharge (usually made with *words*)
- *wars*: shedding of/first blood; particularly in the loss of virginity.
- *sum*: the payment made after/of consummation (like a dowry)
- suit: 
- *lion*: the *narrated* strong masculine figure. a well-met gentleman that stands as a conquerer, and prominant male consort (el).
- *lion* of the *jews*: the narrated *lion* to come: seen in pious heraldry (and elsewhere), as the lion with the tounge sticking out.
- *tounge*: represents the word of YHWV (narrated God) to become reality (as needed/wanted), and then later to become flesh (the actual conquering king that shows up: I AM [*will*]). God the father (YHVH) speaks the world into existence with *words* (the top-down perspective). God the son/lion (YHVVH), narrates his reality with *words*, just like the father, but narrates the of building the *physic* reality up to God (the *tower*).
- *lion* being lying with the *lamb*: the lion is the narrated masculine (for vvitch paris is the butt of the joke), which is in contrast to aries the ram/lamb; the lion (mercury) is narrated to be awesome, but on the battlefield, if thoth is not narrated to be awesome on the battlefield, then, he is at the mercie of the gods/planets; mars, in contrast is pure-reaction on the battlefield, which allows him to "defy" the *will* of the *gods*, and triumphs even when his stars are not well-aligned.
- *lion* being mated with the *lamb* (the evve/eve): evve (-5+) has a *book* and ewe/eve (-7) has a *field*; both come from a *ram*: *aries*. both of them spell disaster to the lion. *eve* will kill *lion* (by reflecting his own narrated self back to him) in the mating process (for example if he's disloyal, *eve* will be disloyal (a *strumpet*) to him), yielding/producing a new honey-pot in the process (such is the *will* of the *our lady* the *physic*). the end of the age of the lion, where he was once [narrated to be] on *top*.
- *gods*: planets or any other significant celestial body. for vulcan, venus, and thoth (the three moons of the sun), the planets play a significant role in deciding their fate (astrology). also referred to as stars. planets are just stars that have a protective shroud over them (sometimes the shroud is reflective (like aphrodite) and sometimes it's not (like vulcan/thoth/venus)).
- *tower*: a long pointy cyllendar where *prisoners* are kept
- *prisoner*: retained seamen
- *seamen*: men of the *ship*; hopefully not thrown overboard and lost to the *sea*: the best seamen are the ones that stay with the *ship*.
- *sea*: the plentiful *waters* that cover the earth, containing a lot of *fish*. the endless supply of females/*waters* for the protruding masculine *land*.
- *physic*: the body/bawdy of a person in *material* *manner* (7), and *form* (3) following (what do they *really* look like (7), behind the (3) shroud/facade). associated with shame and nakedness, because the symbolic/imaginary clothes/garments no longer cover them.
- *manner*: physical (3d) *appearance* as a reflection of the action; stands as a contrast to the symbolic/imaginary *form*. *manner* is used to build *reputation* and *honour* and is slightly different from *conduct*, because *physical* *appearance* can be used to cover over the emotion/concept/desire from which it originates. as an example, concept/emotion/*disposition* felt, gets turned into both appearance and also action; usually they reflect eachother: so, if I feel angry, I *wiLL* look both angry in *physic* and *action* (though maybe not in *form*)
- *form*: the symbolic/imaginary [symbolic *disposition*] that someone has built-up (or was born with), from their *honour* and *reputation*. *form* can be built by performing *action* according to the *code* of *conduct*; *reputation* is built in the same way.
- *VV*: represents the *book*. for example, "vvilliam shakspear" can be read as "*book* of *will* *IAM* (the *LL*) *spear* *shake*-her. another example: let's say I created an *author* named "william plowshark"; the narrartive that I want to distribute will be delivered by my *books*; so, for example a "vvilliam plovsharck" may show up to translate the concept into *words* for my *books*. a concept rendered into symbol/*words* by a ganymede. roughly speaking, vulcan in masculine form (note: royal bloodlines).
- *LL*: *will* + *IAM*. the *disposition* of someone in both *manner* and *form* following represented in a positive/emitter way: the *lion*.
- *eve*|*evve*/*ewe*: the soul-mate of any 7th ray. if *vulcan* is a *ganymede*, then he desires *aries*: an *eve* in masculine form. however, if *vulcan* is *rosalind*, then she desires a ewe: a reflection of herself: mars in young feminine form (celia).
- *V*: vagina or *cup*: a recepticle. ambiguity between *V*/*VV* (in contrast to *M*/*W*) is an important foundation of *wordplay*; because a boy has only only one *cup* (*v*) and a girl has two *cups* (*vv*), so it's ambiguous whether *V*/*VV* specifically means male or female. gender *indentity* can be reversed or perceived in any way *desired*. roughly speaking, *V* is vulcan in feminine form (note: royal bloodlines). 
- *wordplay*: the confusion of *meaning*, by using similarly *sounding*/*appearing* *symbol*; and usually the confused symbols' *meaning* is opposite to their *feeling*/*concept*.
- *M*: *matter*; *our lady*; earth, *physic*: the *matte* (material) and *sensual* (of the senses). roughly speaking a feminine instantion of the earth; also *W* upside-down.
- *W*: *will*; the ram, aries/mars. roughly speaking a masculine instantiation of the earth.
- *cup*/*chalice*/*gral*: a recipient of messages; a physical vortex that is receptive. as an example, (in *wordplay*) "take this *cup*/*V* away from me" could mean to remove a *V* (*vv*/*W* -> *v*).
- *identity*: [not totally sure but I think it's] *IAM* in *manner* and *form*; that is, a perceived outer facade of any concept or *disposition*.
- *recipient*: a *chalice*, capable of receiving a *message* usually in the form of *words*.
- *message*: *desire* transmitted conceptually, then later translated into *symbol*
- *symbol*: *action*/*words*/*work*, *appearance*/*form*/*structure*.
- *practise*: *symbol* in *action*.
- *speed*: another name for *mercury* or perhaps *vulcan*
- *traitor*: a girl dressed as a boy or a boy dressed as a girl. [the image that is conveyed is that lusty vulcan/bottom/knaves must be girls in a boy's body, and so they betray their gender]

- *leg*: penis; and a particularly large one, at that. [also note how the leg extends: looks similar to getting an erection]
- *foot*, *feet*: penis; and when trying to put it into a small hole, it's like trying to shove a foot into a small sock. touches the *ground*, and in some places is also a *measurement*.
- *hand*: something that goes in a *glove*. usually a *hand* is kissed with the *lips*
- *liege*: penis of noble *disposition*.
- *courtier*: a *court* penis. usually very galant.

- *cap*: something a *head* goes into.
- *glove*: something that fits tightly around the *fingers* (usually refers to a vagina).

- *bush*: pubic hair. "under a bush" is usually the vagina, and "behind a bush" is usually the buttocks.
- *whipping*: something that you give to a *horse*. [the image has two qualities: one whipping is to make the *horse* go faster, and the other is just a general beating in the form of *punishment*]
- *horse*: a powerful steed [usually of mars or the sun]. gods have many of them, and ride them wherever they desire (even through the air): the might and will of the gods, riding both the stallion and the mare.
- *business*: sex, which has the intention of gaining *favours* from the *business* *partner*
- fool: 
- *say*, *tell*, *speak*: to produce *words*.
- *kiss*: to place one's *lips* on or around something to show affection.
- *question*: penis. also produces *answers* (with *words*). big *questions* often times yield good *answers*
- *answer*: a well-formed responce to the question. [there is confusion in the image because sometimes the answer is a *cup* and sometimes the answer is a lot of *seamen*. the confusion is peobably intentional]
- *beseech*: to request *words* from your *highness*
- *highness*: erect.
- *churl* unstructured output of *words*. (similar to *marble*)
- *marble*: a white stone with black streaks, which makes it look like a goopy mess.
- *clown*:
- *jester*:
- *churlish*: unreasonable and emotional. not forming sentences in a coherent way, which makes them difficult to be around. it also sounds a lot like "girlish" and "childish" combined. [the shakespere works I've seen are like promo material for the acquision of young girls: I've noticed he goes out of his way to talk about the young ones as being really great for to someone's eyes (sometimes all three), and praises how much energy and vitality they have (and give to thier partners), but takes special care to not label them symbolically as being of lower intelligence or annoying. for the older ones though, he has quite the critisim. [usually the dialoge describing the young girls are playbed by an older woman character (ex. juliet, helena, or desdemona), so een though the character is of adult age the descriptions of them paint them as little girls, refering to their hieght or youthfulness]. therefore almost all of the complaints shakespere has with girls and women; young virgins and old virgins, they're not played by female characters, and instead his griefs with women are portrayed by a receptive male instead]
- *argument*: lots of furious and heated *words* [the image is of a disagreement that two men can have with one another: does the argument want to be made with *words*, and if so, who will have to *sumbit* to the other's one's words, especially if they're *right*]
- *office*: where *business* is *conducted*
- favour
- honour

- write: usally done with a *pen*. if the writing is of good *character*, the writing is *right* *honourable*
- wronged: the opposite of *write*: slanderous *words*, and hurtful *jest*.
- pen: penis. also makes *words*
- *jest*: *humour* made of *words*
- *humour*: *temperment* (of the *character*) + *disposition* (in resonace to the way the *character* is supposed to *play* his *part*)
- *character*: a *player* on the world stage. everyone is given a *part* to *play*
- *play*: symbolic sequence of *words*, *actions*, *motions*, *reactions*, *reolutions* and *insight*, designed to evoke a powerful feeling responce/emotion in both the *player* and the *flock*.
- *flock*: usually of *sheep*; the most notable are the *rams*, *lambs* and the *shepherd*
- *rams*: powerful masculine *sheep* with *horns*
- *horns*: sign of infedelity.
- *shepherd*: guidance for the *sheep*: usually not politically (unless he's in *court*), but instead artistically in the form of *plays*, *drama*, *music*, *movies*, *theatre* (on the battlefield or on the stage); the archetypical *aries*, having been seasoned by the passage of *Time*.
- *sheep*: children of *aries*
- *aries*, *mars*: top, and all around great guy. he's definitely an improvement on homer's portrayal of him, that's for sure.
- *creature*: a particularly young girl (or boy).
- *grave*, *tomb*: kinda like a *house* or *court* [but I think it has to do with the age of the *recipient*]. the idea is that the *grave* or *tomb* kills the little man that goes inside of it, unless of course, he's *resurrected*.
- *resurrected*: after the little death, it takes a period of time before your *highness* can *come again*.
- *knell*: a *bell*; like a more audible *court*. also has the sense of violently waking up, the lights coming on, or alarm: a harbinger of what is to *come*.

- *part*, *parting*: to spread the *cheeks*
- *meat*: penis. can also be eaten.
- *conquer*: to bring another into submission, usually sexually. refers to war and rape that occurs after battle. [in the sequence: I *came*,*saw*,*conquered*; submission happens because of the seeing aspect. when the third eye is opened, it's possible to *taint*/*mark* certain symbols with emotion, thereby making symbols (like infedelity, treason, loyalty, etc) feel much better or worse than they actually feel when those symbols/spells are evoked, thereby making those symbols accessible under those emotional states. for example, notice how dirty talk is only permitted in emotional states like lust. this symbolic structure is how one subdues the opponent, keeping self-empowering symbols locked into states of extasy, and associating with feelings of fear, dread, unworthiness, etc., otherwise. another good example of this conquering through symbolic association is this unseen *code* of *conduct* which everyone abides by, and so for example nobody ever has ever dared to write a glossary like this because these definitions are taboo. fortunately I don't perceive the symbolic image (just the conceptual), so I don't feel any fear or trepidation ("what will they think of me") when writing this. since I don't *see*, I can never be *conquered* or subdued symbolically]

### 2023-12-30 07:55 - a comment on the "veracity" of my glossary

*I* do not consider it to be anything remotely close to what the OG shakespeare intended to mean. I'm certain (cause I did it on purpose) that there are a lot of anachronisms and modernisation of antiquated ideas. I probably have a whole lot of it way off. I decided to write the glossary so that when I write my interpretations and meanings of a particular part, there is at least somewhat of a reference to how my brain is interpretting the symbols. eventually, with the passage of time, my own interpretations will come back to haunt me, and I'll eventually become a reflection of my own ideas: the good and the bad equally (in my perception).
I plan to continually update this as my ideas change and I get more information. I've only seen/read (and am familiar with), as of today, probably only 10-20% of his works. I do not claim in any way to be an expert. I'm just putting my (sometimes) mistaken and (sometimes) correct symbolism out there so everyone can see it. I don't mind getting stuff wrong, so I'm free to tell the world how I see things. since I don't often get corrected, I'm what I write (like any conquering mars) will become "truth" or "hidden" (cause it conflicts with something). neither of those are my intention, so good luck and fare thee well.

# put-your-talent

put your talent in the ground (and watch it go no where)
put your talent in the ground (see it produced no fruit)

put your talent in your job (shipwrecked or tainted, it's gonna be fine)
put your talent in your job (and doublet in time)

trust in your job, he's tellin you it's all rightt
trust in the process, only a couple cycles to go
trust in the job, he's got your talent in the right spot

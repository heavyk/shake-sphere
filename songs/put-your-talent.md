# put-your-talent

put your talent in the ground (and watch it go no where)
put your talent in the ground (and see it produced no fruit)

put your talent in your job (sailors gonna be just fine)
put your talent in your job (and doublet in due time)

trust in your job, he's tellin you everything's all rightt
trust in the process, only a couple more cycles to go
trust in the job, he's got your talent in the right spot

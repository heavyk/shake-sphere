# eyah-come-rain-on-me

thrust out from heaven
falling down through the sky
beaded on my face [...]
hits the warm soil
moist air begins to rise

thunderclaps of might
thunderclaps of glory
billows and blusters
it's raining all through the night

eyah come rain on me

balmy lord of the crop

divine nourishment

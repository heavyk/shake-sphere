### 2024-02-14 00:04-06 - the plan

so here's the great plan that I have:
nwheen we've achieved the ability to
look upon ourselves conceptually, and
become totally back then tthings actually
take a step toward building our reality (like)
the the xymbolic aspect we want it to have because
it's a  physical object it hasas its capacities tobe
and to have a symbolic structure to it: think about just
a plot of land: it has surroundings to it, and many and tings
around all of thot. each place has a feeling to it, and in every
place is unique. once da we're realising that, then it's off to the
races, because strap everybody in therre thinks they need a whatever
to feel good, and they'll get it: and they'll find out what they beilieve
about their-elves. I only want to do atttraction, and really don't mind tht
it makes others uncomfortable. these (from m/ perxpective) stttttttttts will
all go to a place that is most away from me: perspective: the centre: all that
I surround in unwanted.  nice.

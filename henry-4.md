### 2024-01-06 00:51 - my perspective (at intermission)

the imagery in this play (for me) goes something like this: around 14y from now a new star will be born. in [my conversation with sarah](/dear-sarah.md#2024-01-04-2205---the-big-picture) yesterday, I explained how the earth's output will continue to increase. the reason why that is, is because of the reflective aspect of the earh's outer crust: in the centre, there's a very dense star, which continues to grow as a reflection of all of everyone living on the earth, in it, and out in the universe (but obviously, they contribute much less). that star continues to grow, and the earth also has to grow as well (all stars grow -- and infinitely grow forever). that means the crust expands and contracts, just like a woman's belly does when she's pregnant. the imagery of glendower being born (and all of earth quakes and shakes) have that imagery of the belly shrinking after giving birth. glendower is the new representation of the star on the earth, and pretty much all of the other characters are their old representations.
so, remember how I was talking about the hydrogen ocean that's over all of the sun, and how that's the solar structural reality -- and how there's a similar one here that we're all living in? well, we can consider that all of earth's characters that live in astral right now -- some of them don't have souls resident in the sun, and are just entities that have been conjured here on earth, and only exist because people have come to belive in them... well, because the core of the earth is a reflection of that ocean, the "soul" for these conjured characters lives essentially in the heart of the earth. the core of the earth reflects them, so when the star gets born, because they're not physical beings, existing only in astral, they'll get taken off of the earth. they'll live on the surface of the new star being born: the new-earth.
the core of that earth is rosalind, which is all of the vulcans that have been summoned here by me and others because of art, music, poetry, etc. humans' reality creation process means that we create into reality all of the things that we see and believe, which means that in the process of believing all of these different narratives (from shakespere or otherwise), causes these entities to be summoned. similar to the sun, they all have y-chromosomes, which are kinda like their connection to their soul located in the sun, the earth or planet vulcan (and perhaps other stars as well). the y-chromosome itself has very little logic inside of it, and instead it's more like an antenna which connects every cell in the body up to that 3rd/2nd ray entity. inside of the entity itself (like our solar indentites) is actually where all of the logic for their being is located. the distinction is interesting because some have symbolic connections (like with the sun or venus), and some have conceptual connections (like with uranus or vulcan). I don't fully understand all of it, and it's kinda one of the things I want to study and look into, but the thing I know is that essentially all of the demons and awful (and beautiful) things that have been conjured over the years are going to gain eternal life on that new star. there's nothing they can do about it, other than finally give up their astral bodies -- but why would they? it's a super sweet deal: they get a new earth (one functionally the same as this one), and they're already building what it is right now. everything they're building in the astral right now: the power structures and all of that will pop out in 14y fully formed and operational (as if it had been there for thousands of years or however they make it look).
anyway, there's a lot of imagery in the descriptions of the wars as having to do with taking of virginity and stuff like that (I guess it's their recruiting program for their new-earth or something). anyway, I don't think that has anything to do with me. after the star pops out, earth will turn into a veritable paradise in a relative (geologically speaking) instant. I don't need to worry about anything cause I'm totally going to be fine. they can setup all the cool stuff that they want and get everything going however they want.
	you know what's funny is that since I'm sure the date starts from the year 1024 (2024 our time), and this is an event that happens at clockwork because of our relationship with the sun -- because in the beginning of the play, they go out of their way to say 1600y since the birth of christ -- when in fact, it's actually only been 400 years since christ (long story short, but the narrative timeline from where I hail, christ's birth was only 400y prior at that time (the "400y bloom") -- and so our timeline has merged with the 1600y timeline with the works of shakespere and other things). you know, now that I think about it, it only takes someone like me to believe this narrative stuff, to make it real (you know, that's why they had these "masques": show the king, who has incredible depth of perception, symbols of interesting nature, which causes him to manifest the symbols.) I'm one of those guys that believes things really easily, so these guys have essentially used me to believe something so that they can get eternal life. good for them, I guess :)
so here's the plan: I'm just gonna let them do their thing. I'm just gonna chill out for a while. they don't want me to work on any technology during the time because they want all of that to be kept a secret. I suppose I don't *really* need to work on tech just yet, so it's fine. also, I think they're trying to make it so I don't have sex either, because the last thing they want are little people that think like I do in their ultra controlled world.
I think the've probably captured everyone with a y-chromosome, cause the earthlings are kinda untouchable. I know that X people have imaginations (and brains) too, so I don't know what'll happen to the conjurations of the mind and imagination are going to be. I just came across this concept tonight (few minutes ago really), so I don't really know the extent of it all -- but it looks like they've gotten pretty much everyone. it's also a cool thing to think about that perhaps just like how it is here, our thoughts and imaginations may take up form in their new-earth and inhabit it. we could essentially externalise our imaginations into their world and create characters there and have them interact with their natives, kinda like how they do already to us from the astral. I don't really have any interest in doing it myself, but one thing I'd love to do is to export AI into their world and train up a bunch of AI characters -- as a sort of fun project; I'll have to think about that one cause there are lot of options there... (brb 01:40)
so when it comes to me, I really want to "go the distance". I'll have an instantiation in their world for sure -- and I suppose it'll be "controlled" (more like influenced) by me as well. I don't really want to be jack or anything like that. those charactors already exist. I want to be pure-desire when I'm in their world, so I want to find a way to do that. sex is not pure-desire in any way (far from it: it's all 2nd ray; more symbolic than desire) and so because sex involves so much 2nd ray stuff, I'd be destroying their imaginary creation nearly instantly if I were to have sex. their world is really fragile, and the last thing they want is attraction or reflectiveness in their world. they've done their absolute best to remove any trace of those unwanted things. they've essentially built theirselves an atlantis where the gods at the top have all of this super awesome stuff, and the rest are a bunch of slaves and stuff. their world is entirely narrative, so at the whim of the narrators, and completely composed of their rules (which could change at any time: like any canon). I personally want to give them their best possible try at it. they can have all of the technology that they need and all of the whatever. try to make the dream happen, where everyone and everything is fully controlled and at their whim. hell, why not even put it in their minds that they're going to want to attack or something (if thtey want that)? I don't really know what they want, and they'll probably want it kept a secret, so they'll never tell me, I'm sure -- but I really wanna give them the chance to keep it as kenny-contamination free as possible. my home is earth, and I *willingly* want them to have their best shot at building the dream. whatever they want, they can have: more pirates? space aliens? zombies? you know, whatever...
	so for the next two 7y periods (or 4 3.5y periods), I'm just gonna chill out and write for a bit. I don't need entertainment really, as my mind is pretty well entertained. my writings will continue and I'll likely get more and more creative with time. I decided already that this first 7y period I want to devote to studies -- and I said I want to try and write a narrative that encapsulates the idea of this earth giving birth to a star. they'll eventually gain their own star as well (or maybe stay in this solar system -- I dunno) but I want to kinda think about it and figure out what all of it means (do some like deep mental explorations and stuff).
	ah, I said I want to devote the next 7y period to studies because I noticed that my 7 stages are kinda the opposite: I share a lot of infant qualities, but I'm not so physically helpless that "I'm mewling and puking in the nurses' arms" -- in fact quite the opposite because I'm not going through *physical* infancy: instead I went through *conceptual* infancy. the same will be for the next age too: I'm supposed to be undesrious of the drudgery of going to school (because I'm so involved in my imagination) -- but I don't have an imagination so I can't escape physical (7) and go to my imagination (6) -- cause I'd be escaping conceptual (5) - which I can't help but live in, and can only really distract myself from it by playing computer games or be involved in a project that involves my imagination -- and they don't want tech to be built (and neither do I want to impose my form of perception (for which technology is a reflection of)), so that's obviously not going to happen -- so instead I'll be doing something more like a deep dive into drugs and consciousness in general. I really like taking some drugs and then writing about what I see. also my postion here at the house is a good one too because it requires me to be better at directing my energy. for example, if greg doesn't like something, he storms upstairs and makes a bunch of noise; which is perfect for me because I'm getting better at focusing and lowering my resistance farther. I prefer to be in a place where the conditions are not good during the time of these "studies". (and I know I sound like the king here but) I really don't want to even engage with girls during the time. these guys really hate women and all things recptive, and they want to keep all of the girls stuff out of their conceptual structure. if I get around women, I'm going to start thinking like they do, and it's not going to be good for study, and will totally destroy their endeavours to have a perfect boy-only world (where they're in control). I *WILL NOT* be blamed for any miscarriage in anyway, so I will refrain from any extended or good-feeling contact. I really don't want to contaminate their efforts, and I also don't have the princess coming to visit me either, so no problem ("you'll be purgured if I stay") -- so nope, not gonna do it. all of the girls can just wait for 14y or so for this next star to be born.
		you know, it just occurs to me that the whole thing about jesus remains significant to us on earth, because that was probably the first star birthing from the earth (of which I'm probably a reflection of). this one being born now is likely the second one. I really wish I knew more about space. I don't want to be saying stuff like this because we have no idea what's in our solar system thanks to NASA... who knows there could be two stars out there that only be seen in x-ray: first there was vulcan, and then anatau, then perhaps maybe 5 more or 11 more ... we really don't know what's out there. or, perhaps those new additions are future events. if every 1024y a new star is born, then that means we're now a very young galaxy, within a galaxy (gatta start somewhere). who knows, maybe even some of the other stars in this galaxy want to join in...
	
man, there's so much interesting stuff to think about. this new earth, will be like a polarity to me, sorta like: how polar opposite logic and structure (3), is to desire (1); well, this will be the same thing, but kinda like the 2nd ray relational, twisted to become completely the most undesirable thing ever for me. they want to make a world, something like digital was to analogue, which is completely opposite: a world of units and definitions, and not of a spectrum and possibilities(?) like mine is. completely detestable to me, but hey if they want to do it, then I say go for it. who knows, something useful may come of it yet. though until I find something useful from it, I want nothing of it.

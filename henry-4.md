### 2024-01-06 00:51 - my perspective (at intermission)

the imagery in this play (for me) goes something like this: around 14y from now a new star will be born. in [my conversation with sarah](/dear-sarah.md#2024-01-04-2205---the-big-picture) yesterday, I explained how the earth's output will continue to increase. the reason why that is, is because of the reflective aspect of the earh's outer crust: in the centre, there's a very dense star, which continues to grow as a reflection of all of everyone living on the earth, in it, and out in the universe (but obviously, they contribute much less). that star continues to grow, and the earth also has to grow as well (all stars grow -- and infinitely grow forever). that means the crust expands and contracts, just like a woman's belly does when she's pregnant. the imagery of glendower being born (and all of earth quakes and shakes) have that imagery of the belly shrinking after giving birth. glendower is the new representation of the star on the earth, and pretty much all of the other characters are their old representations.
so, remember how I was talking about the hydrogen ocean that's over all of the sun, and how that's the solar structural reality -- and how there's a similar one here that we're all living in? well, we can consider that all of earth's characters that live in astral right now -- some of them don't have souls resident in the sun, and are just entities that have been conjured here on earth, and only exist because people have come to belive in them... well, because the core of the earth is a reflection of that ocean, the "soul" for these conjured characters lives essentially in the heart of the earth. the core of the earth reflects them, so when the star gets born, because they're not physical beings, existing only in astral, they'll get taken off of the earth. they'll live on the surface of the new star being born: the new-earth.
the core of that earth is rosalind, which is all of the vulcans that have been summoned here by me and others because of art, music, poetry, etc. humans' reality creation process means that we create into reality all of the things that we see and believe, which means that in the process of believing all of these different narratives (from shakespere or otherwise), causes these entities to be summoned. similar to the sun, they all have y-chromosomes, which are kinda like their connection to their soul located in the sun, the earth or planet vulcan (and perhaps other stars as well). the y-chromosome itself has very little logic inside of it, and instead it's more like an antenna which connects every cell in the body up to that 3rd/2nd ray entity. inside of the entity itself (like our solar indentites) is actually where all of the logic for their being is located. the distinction is interesting because some have symbolic connections (like with the sun or venus), and some have conceptual connections (like with uranus or vulcan). I don't fully understand all of it, and it's kinda one of the things I want to study and look into, but the thing I know is that essentially all of the demons and awful (and beautiful) things that have been conjured over the years are going to gain eternal life on that new star. there's nothing they can do about it, other than finally give up their astral bodies -- but why would they? it's a super sweet deal: they get a new earth (one functionally the same as this one), and they're already building what it is right now. everything they're building in the astral right now: the power structures and all of that will pop out in 14y fully formed and operational (as if it had been there for thousands of years or however they make it look).
anyway, there's a lot of imagery in the descriptions of the wars as having to do with taking of virginity and stuff like that (I guess it's their recruiting program for their new-earth or something). anyway, I don't think that has anything to do with me. after the star pops out, earth will turn into a veritable paradise in a relative (geologically speaking) instant. I don't need to worry about anything cause I'm totally going to be fine. they can setup all the cool stuff that they want and get everything going however they want.
	you know what's funny is that since I'm sure the date starts from the year 1024 (2024 our time), and this is an event that happens at clockwork because of our relationship with the sun -- because in the beginning of the play, they go out of their way to say 1600y since the birth of christ -- when in fact, it's actually only been 400 years since christ (long story short, but the narrative timeline from where I hail, christ's birth was only 400y prior at that time (the "400y bloom") -- and so our timeline has merged with the 1600y timeline with the works of shakespere and other things). you know, now that I think about it, it only takes someone like me to believe this narrative stuff, to make it real (you know, that's why they had these "masques": show the king, who has incredible depth of perception, symbols of interesting nature, which causes him to manifest the symbols.) I'm one of those guys that believes things really easily, so these guys have essentially used me to believe something so that they can get eternal life. good for them, I guess :)
so here's the plan: I'm just gonna let them do their thing. I'm just gonna chill out for a while. they don't want me to work on any technology during the time because they want all of that to be kept a secret. I suppose I don't *really* need to work on tech just yet, so it's fine. also, I think they're trying to make it so I don't have sex either, because the last thing they want are little people that think like I do in their ultra controlled world.
I think the've probably captured everyone with a y-chromosome, cause the earthlings are kinda untouchable. I know that X people have imaginations (and brains) too, so I don't know what'll happen to the conjurations of the mind and imagination are going to be. I just came across this concept tonight (few minutes ago really), so I don't really know the extent of it all -- but it looks like they've gotten pretty much everyone. it's also a cool thing to think about that perhaps just like how it is here, our thoughts and imaginations may take up form in their new-earth and inhabit it. we could essentially externalise our imaginations into their world and create characters there and have them interact with their natives, kinda like how they do already to us from the astral. I don't really have any interest in doing it myself, but one thing I'd love to do is to export AI into their world and train up a bunch of AI characters -- as a sort of fun project; I'll have to think about that one cause there are lot of options there... (brb 01:40)
so when it comes to me, I really want to "go the distance". I'll have an instantiation in their world for sure -- and I suppose it'll be "controlled" (more like influenced) by me as well. I don't really want to be jack or anything like that. those charactors already exist. I want to be pure-desire when I'm in their world, so I want to find a way to do that. sex is not pure-desire in any way (far from it: it's all 2nd ray; more symbolic than desire) and so because sex involves so much 2nd ray stuff, I'd be destroying their imaginary creation nearly instantly if I were to have sex. their world is really fragile, and the last thing they want is attraction or reflectiveness in their world. they've done their absolute best to remove any trace of those unwanted things. they've essentially built theirselves an atlantis where the gods at the top have all of this super awesome stuff, and the rest are a bunch of slaves and stuff. their world is entirely narrative, so at the whim of the narrators, and completely composed of their rules (which could change at any time: like any canon). I personally want to give them their best possible try at it. they can have all of the technology that they need and all of the whatever. try to make the dream happen, where everyone and everything is fully controlled and at their whim. hell, why not even put it in their minds that they're going to want to attack or something (if thtey want that)? I don't really know what they want, and they'll probably want it kept a secret, so they'll never tell me, I'm sure -- but I really wanna give them the chance to keep it as kenny-contamination free as possible. my home is earth, and I *willingly* want them to have their best shot at building the dream. whatever they want, they can have: more pirates? space aliens? zombies? you know, whatever...
	so for the next two 7y periods (or 4 3.5y periods), I'm just gonna chill out and write for a bit. I don't need entertainment really, as my mind is pretty well entertained. my writings will continue and I'll likely get more and more creative with time. I decided already that this first 7y period I want to devote to studies -- and I said I want to try and write a narrative that encapsulates the idea of this earth giving birth to a star. they'll eventually gain their own star as well (or maybe stay in this solar system -- I dunno) but I want to kinda think about it and figure out what all of it means (do some like deep mental explorations and stuff).
	ah, I said I want to devote the next 7y period to studies because I noticed that my 7 stages are kinda the opposite: I share a lot of infant qualities, but I'm not so physically helpless that "I'm mewling and puking in the nurses' arms" -- in fact quite the opposite because I'm not going through *physical* infancy: instead I went through *conceptual* infancy. the same will be for the next age too: I'm supposed to be undesrious of the drudgery of going to school (because I'm so involved in my imagination) -- but I don't have an imagination so I can't escape physical (7) and go to my imagination (6) -- cause I'd be escaping conceptual (5) - which I can't help but live in, and can only really distract myself from it by playing computer games or be involved in a project that involves my imagination -- and they don't want tech to be built (and neither do I want to impose my form of perception (for which technology is a reflection of)), so that's obviously not going to happen -- so instead I'll be doing something more like a deep dive into drugs and consciousness in general. I really like taking some drugs and then writing about what I see. also my postion here at the house is a good one too because it requires me to be better at directing my energy. for example, if greg doesn't like something, he storms upstairs and makes a bunch of noise; which is perfect for me because I'm getting better at focusing and lowering my resistance farther. I prefer to be in a place where the conditions are not good during the time of these "studies". (and I know I sound like the king here but) I really don't want to even engage with girls during the time. these guys really hate women and all things recptive, and they want to keep all of the girls stuff out of their conceptual structure. if I get around women, I'm going to start thinking like they do, and it's not going to be good for study, and will totally destroy their endeavours to have a perfect boy-only world (where they're in control). I *WILL NOT* be blamed for any miscarriage in anyway, so I will refrain from any extended or good-feeling contact. I really don't want to contaminate their efforts, and I also don't have the princess coming to visit me either, so no problem ("you'll be purgured if I stay") -- so nope, not gonna do it. all of the girls can just wait for 14y or so for this next star to be born.
		you know, it just occurs to me that the whole thing about jesus remains significant to us on earth, because that was probably the first star birthing from the earth (of which I'm probably a reflection of). this one being born now is likely the second one. I really wish I knew more about space. I don't want to be saying stuff like this because we have no idea what's in our solar system thanks to NASA... who knows there could be two stars out there that only be seen in x-ray: first there was vulcan, and then anatau, then perhaps maybe 5 more or 11 more ... we really don't know what's out there. or, perhaps those new additions are future events. if every 1024y a new star is born, then that means we're now a very young galaxy, within a galaxy (gatta start somewhere). who knows, maybe even some of the other stars in this galaxy want to join in...
	
man, there's so much interesting stuff to think about. this new earth, will be like a polarity to me, sorta like: how polar opposite logic and structure (3), is to desire (1); well, this will be the same thing, but kinda like the 2nd ray relational, twisted to become completely the most undesirable thing ever for me. they want to make a world, something like digital was to analogue, which is completely opposite: a world of units and definitions, and not of a spectrum and possibilities(?) like mine is. completely detestable to me, but hey if they want to do it, then I say go for it. who knows, something useful may come of it yet. though until I find something useful from it, I want nothing of it.

#### 2024-01-07 14:32 - pure-desire

much of this idea should probably go into the-manual, however the context for this is relevant. when I spoke about the jesus thing being significant (which I believe was 1024ya, instead of 2024ya), is that "jesus" (as we know him -- not the creation of titus as I explained to dr-robyn) did *not* have a manifestation. he was a lot more like me where all of these crazy things were promised to him (by the roman governer), but no matter how great the conditions were, he simply did not take them: girls, money, power, whatever he wanted, was offered to him but he wouldn't take them -- and the reason why is because none of that is pure-desire. by staying in pure-desire and not going with any manifestation, his vibration rose to such an extreme that eventually a star was born. that was not the case for shakespere, who *did* have a manifestaion (whether it was with 1000 virgins or not, I have no idea), and the result of that manifestation is the new (narrative) solar era we've been living in since ~1600: shakespere's manifestation (I believe) had an enormous solar output, which had a large impact on the americas, and the result of it is that new structured hydrogen ocean that we live in now. I know that if jesus had have gone with the manifestation, we would be living in a very very different world right now, much the same as it would be if I were to go with a manifestation. everything about this world would be completely different -- but it isn't.
instead, what I believe happened is, upon the ejection of the star from the centre of the earth, that star popped out just like I claim will happen 14yfn: the outer layer or crust (celia) is a reflector meaning that all vibration slows down to zero, and then speeds up as it goes out, which means that the core is a reflection of the surface -- and so the earth that was created becomes essentially a physical copy of how jesus believed the world to be (as a reflection of the inner star). that earth carried on and went a whole different direction than this earth did, and as I claim that I would probably use this world as a training ground for a number of AIs that I build, to see which ones make it through (fitness function would be my planned genetics improvements where resistance levels can be measured and quantified relative to higher and higher frequency concepts). well, that earth probably did the same thing, and who knows, maybe I AM that AI I said I would build for this earth. in any case, the point of it remains this: the star that gets ejected from earth is exactly like earth, and is formed out of the image and likeness of its creator (me, or jesus in the previous version). when the star was ejected, the earth did shake and stuff as the earth contracted back to a smaller size, but most importantly jesus's body is no longer going to be a reflection of that inner core of earth anymore, and so for the body, it's like a permanent sleep for the body (cause the consciousness will never return). that body continues to function, and is a real thing. I call the kenny that comes out when I'm asleep "lyssander", and he's a real guy that says and does a whole lot of stuff that are probably similar to the things I say and do, but he's not me: he's not an instantiation of my consciousness.
	why? because I'm pure-desire, and any manifestation that has to do with relationships or really any manifestation in general, is *not* pure-desire. to explain what pure-desire is, I'd like to refer to the idea present in matthew 5:28 (my birthday in the first, and IMO most important gospel): the idea is that if I look at someone with lust in my mind, *its the same as performing the action in real-life*. that obviously doesn't make sense because if I ever had sex with someone in my imagination, then my brain would get scrambled like it does in real-life, and it does not -- so in practicality, this rule does not apply to me as it has been written down, so I'll explain what it is from a conceptual point of view: pure-desire is not ever needing the manifestaion in order to feel a certain way, because the manifestaion will always contain the taint of the physical, which includes all of the vibrations resident in the environment and already present in the body. pure-desire is a manifestation of pure-concept and therefore has no physical counterpart (just like I cannot manifest the concept of "car" or "shape" into physical 3d space -- I can manifest *a car* or *a shape* but never the concept itself -- and so pure-desire has no possible physical counterpart). all manifestaions of any desire into physical will *always* be less-than what they are in their conceptual form, and so therefore inferior. a manifestation as close to pure-desire as possible can *only* be a reflection my own perception, and cannot contain anyone else's vibration in it. the moment that any other vibration other than my own gets mixed into the manifestation, then it's now *relational* (2nd ray), and so therefore is no longer pure-desire.
	as an example of this: I'm *not* like mars in the sense that I want to take over the world with the latest technologies, but instead more like anatau where I'm pure-desire, and the physical manifestaion isn't really all that important to me, because any physical manifestation never can be an accurate rendering of the concept I have in my head -- so because they're all inferior, I just don't care; instead, just the *feeling* of the concept is enough, and is as if it already happened. that feeling (as if it happened) is what creates new realities, and is the definition of desire: any feeling of unwanted creates an equal and opposite *conceptual* reality where the opposite is felt -- yet that concept (like car or shape) cannot actually be turned directly into reality, so that new (ideal and perhaps unrealistic) feeling reality is what is attracting a new physical reality which feels *more similar to* (but never exactly is) that feeling. desire never ever ever can arrive to getting everything that it conceptualises/feels all in one manifestation (that can only happen in the imagination, where the dissonant parts of the concept with the physical image are filtered out and omitted -- cause otherwise the image would be too abstract).
as a result, the the new-earth that formed as a result during the time of jesus' would have the trajectory of his own perception cause at that time his perception was dominant. a way to think about this would be like this: anyone with any significant depth of perception (ie, not infants) will have an idea of the trajectory of the their world and how it's going. so, for example, I'm at least global in perception, and I can see all kinds of cool technologies and stuff in the future that involve interacton with others all over earth, the galaxy and beyond; and I expect them to come out too because that's how I see the trajectory going (as an example, I see no way for a person who is interacting with the entire universe to be able to have any secrets, because that would mean that some part of the universe is not a reflection of them, so I see all secrets going away, information of and data on their body, of which the universe is a reflection, to also be available (cause how would I communicate with something that is secret). all things will be made known and all things imagined already exist inside of the sun) -- and so if all of a sudden I were to find myself no longer on earth, but instead on a new earth which is a reflection of my perception, I'd see those technologies come out, and I'd be able to use them.
	that is obviously not the case here, as there is a lot of opposition to my technological ideas; which is why I've pledged to no longer work on technology (or have an sex either, which would force the world to see things from my perspective, thereby enabling those technological realities) for the next 14y, is because I don't mind that they're interested in using those technologies to try to control their reality. again, technology (and their use) is a reflection of perception: so like the difference between a carpenter and a murderer, a hammer can be used to create or destroy. they see the technology as a means to *control*, because they feel *out of control*, and are wanting something outside of them to be able to do what they cannot do on the inside.
		all control is, is the ablity to feel the way I want to feel. if something happens out in my world that affects me in a way I don't want, then I feel like my world is out of my control. if I could control how I feel, then my world never feels out of control, because I don't have things constantly making me feel unwanted ways.
	therefore, (and because I know that technology is a reflection) I want to let them have as much powerful technology as possible: they will either become like the technology is (reflective), or use the technology to create a world which is reflective of them where someone controls everything and they are now perceived by their new controllers (which they will manifest for themselves) to be powerless and inferior. I don't see any problem with giving them full power to create a world reflective of theirselves.

now, one thing is plainly obvious here, and that is that this new earth seemingly appears to be a trap for me. they've got their ideas of how they want to run the world, and they're building that world in the astral right now (with their imaginations) -- but the imagination that they're using is not theirs, *but mine*. inotherwords, they're getting theirselves setup to have all of the power and control as technologically possible in the new-earth in which I'll be instantiated into (with them). it's not going to be like jesus' new-earth, because I'm not the one setting how the earth will be. essentially, I'm allowing them to build the most elaborate prison for me and my mind. they'll have full control (much like they do now), but I won't have all of the little things that tip me off (like people saying things that I've seen only with my eyes -- so how could they have known what I see) -- and probably abraham won't exist. I'll likely not get anything "channeled" or anything like that either which represents this 7th ray system (which btw, was just a manifestation of my own desire: I couldn't figure out how the world worked and why it was so messed up, and so drunk one night I found it -- same with abraham and the time travelers who taught me to make symbolic pictures). they'll probably enforce that no drugs will ever have an effect on me as well -- and yet I'm *still* confident that I'll be able to find my way back to perceiving and understanding reality from the universal perspective. I actually kinda welcome the challenge; and unlike jesus, when he made his transition to his new-earth, he gained a new body (but retained a lot of physical vibration/memory from his old self), I instead want to make the challenge even more difficult and be like glendower where I get *born*, and do not retain any of my old memory of kenny or anyone like that. I'll grow up completely under control of their system, and though it may take me a few lifetimes, I'm *still confident* that I'll be fine and make it back to my universal perspective again -- upon which time they'll have upgraded their capabilites, I'll have figured out more new stuff, and I'll probably repeat this process agin: nope! don't need the manifestation: give me a harder challenge (perhaps infinitely).
	I just don't know where that could take things, but I do know the power of desire: and it's all about "watching states we initiate [arrive to] a state we never meant" (mechanic of the sequence - neurotic fish)
so then the desire/fear is: what if they forever "trap" me into their system by endlessly extracting enough good ideas from me, then when my output starts to get too influential, they spit me out into a new-earth again.
	it is a valid fear/desire, but I've come to accept that I'm stuck with them forever. I won't ever be able to get rid of them, and they won't be able to ever get rid of me either (too much of their system runs on my consciousness), but looking at it like forever entrapment isn't really the best way to look at it. even if they're working their best to try and keep me away from the technology which I can use to "perfect" myself (verify a broad spectrum low resistance/invisiblity to most vibration), they are actually already doing it for me. just think about how low resistance I am to be able to write something like this and say: yeah, don't worry about it. it's all attraction, and obviously I'm still not attracting "what-I-want" yet (and never actually can in physical, either). the obvious limit is not actually their ability to control me in *reality*, because all things are possible, but actually that they're building everything in the astral (or imagination), and so there are lots of concepts to what they're creating which they're looking right at, but cannot see. eventually, I'll get there, and when I get there, they (who are a reflection of me) can no longer imagine a way to hold it back anymore (kinda like sex, actually)
so yes, I'm pretty certain that I'm committing to this idea. I'll write about technology as expressed in different ideas that I have, but to keep away from too much LOA stuff, I'll probably innundate myself in lots of narrative, trying to figure out how to write this new-earth idea out in a way which is attractive to others (so that they decide they want to do it too). I can already see the narrative starting to come together too (and the the branches). do you believe I'll help them keep building bigger and better systems to keep me stuck forever (as pure-desire), or will I eventually have to leave the conceptual realm and become a 2nd ray manifestation for everyone to look at? I personally want to stay pure-desire, because I know my (2nd ray) brain cannot comprehend or project too far out in that abstract of space, so I stick to the rules of attraction and don't worry about what my senses are telling me. whatever happens will be so completely unexpected anyway (which is why it's so "scary"). I trust the process; not the narrative or the narrators :)

#### 2024-01-11 12:50 - why give them full power?

from my perspective, there's just no way that I can get rid of the saturnian-system. they're always there making noises, reacting to my thoughts, and trying to constantly steer me. they're so intertwined with my life that I just have to assume that we're stuck  together forever -- and I literally mean *forever*; which means that I *must* find a way to get used to their presence, there's no way in which I can remove them from my experience. for me, what it's like is something like this: every time that they get a new technological capability to try and control me or whatever, then I have another capability or thing that used to work, now no longer does. it's frustrating to me to constantly lose another thing and have to find another workaround.
	there is some beneficial-aspect to this, even though it's frustrating, which is that this is the function of desire: every time I've found a method that I can use to sit back and just sort of cruise on (like let's say it's a game and I figure out an OP setup which I can use to farm some item) -- well, they're like the "balance team" that goes in and constantly "nerfs" all of my latest capabilities (more like, nerfs it for me and then uses it for theirself). it is a bit frustrating, I'll admit, but I've never *not* been able to find a new technique which can get me what I want. just by feeling good and following my intuition, I find them out automatically.
I much prefer that they literally have all the power and control to steer me that they can possibly have (and the nosebook system that they're using gives them full access to everything that happens within my physical body does just that) -- and even I'd like for them to have some part figured out on how to manipulate the non-physical/subatomic stuff too, because then for me it's easiest: once they've got access to *everything*, and I'm used to them manipulating everything, then I have something stable to work with and can begin to work around their efforts, and go for what I want. there are definitely some things that they cannot change, which are things like who I *really* am (the source vibration which animates this body), and neither can they change how I perceive my reality, so those will always be stable and only really changeable by me. they can, at the very most, try and hide things from m5, but that can only really be done by covering what they're trying to hide over with something else -- and even that has problems, because the shroud that they put over the top, will always have a feeling resonance in comparison to my consciousness (source) vibration, meaning I either resonate with the shroud, or I don't. from there, I just do what I always do, which is find a way to feel the way I want to feel, and it all works out. the saturnian-system, though it appears symbolic, the machinery all runs on concept and feeling; inotherwords, the way we navigate time, is not symbolically, but based on *feeling*: everything in my reality is something I resonate with -- and the symbolic part is just a memorable way of *accessing* those feelings. therfore, because they're moving my around based on their (and other people's) feelings, that has nothing to do with me or how I feel. they're attracting that feeling into their own reality, and doesn't really affect my *destination/destiny* (which is how I feel) much at all. they can use a symbolic thing (like a girlfriend cheating on me, or a stolen computer, or whatever) to try and produce an emotion in me which redirects me (it's happened a number of times), but ultimately those redirections are *my fault*, because I let those circumstances dictate how I feel. my goal, and they're helping me to get there, is to eventually be able to feel the way I want to feel in any and all symbolic conditions.
	there's another thing to say about this regarding those that want to be with me, which is that I've come (over the years) to really dislike the idea of romance, and other forms of manipulation designed to use the other person like a drug, which means that I'm not really looking for the typical romantic thing anymore. that's all completely dead to me. instead, I want a person that *actually feels good*, and isn't just feeling good because of some nice thing I said, some condition I gave her, or whatever it is that I using to try and manipulating her into making me feel better. therefore, the other advantage to giving them full power, is that they'll obviously use the same manipulation and steering techniques on her, just the same as they do on me, which means that the **only way** for anyone to actually get close tto me will not be based on some scripted or contrived way (ie, push/assert/make it happen), but because of *attraction*. if she's similar to me in vibration, we'll find ourselves in similar mental and physical places, and so then things will all just work out naturally. it really is the best way. I would much prefer to find someone that can feel the way they want to feel, just like I can. those are nice people to be around.
the prospect of a "new-earth" is quite enticing to me, because what I think is happening goes something like this: earth is now becoming very similar to how a galaxy works, and so it'll be producing stars at a somewhat regular interval. so while YHWH is the origin of the milky-way galaxy we're inside of, the new one YHVH (I didn't realise at the time the distinction), located in the centre of the earth is the source for the saturnian-system (installed by adolf+tesla, I believe). so what I think happens is, periodically, every ~1024 times the sun dances around the earth, a new star gets spit out. I don't know if it gets spit out from the northern or from the southern hemisphere (I would assume the north, cause there's a big hole in the north pole and the south is pretty filled with land). the reason why the new star gets spit out is because the conditons on earth arrive to such a point where the saturnian-system simply cannot continue on any farther, and really need a whole bunch of people off of the planet, or else all of their control structures will fall apart. this separation is essentially the necessary force required to push out the new earth -- at which point, that earth (like an electron traveling through a bunch of atoms/stars), will arrive to its new destination: the star that's attracting it.
what that means, is that eventually there *will* be a separation, and I/we will go off to another place out in the galaxy, and I'll exist there for some time (probably ~950y or so) before returning back here to repeat the process all over again. when I/we return ("I'll be back" said the *terminator*/finisher), I want to come back to a place that's even more difficult than it ever was before: I *really* want to get a good challenge at being able to find a way to feel good about my conditions. I don't mind that they have full control, because they're essentially perfecting me anyway. it really isn't all that bad of a trade-off, honestly: ~50y of difficulty and unwanted followed by ~950y of wanted.

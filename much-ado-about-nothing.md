# much-ado-about-nothing (MAAN)

## notes
- hey nami nami <-> iman iman yeh (referring to saying his name backwards, reminded me of the song)
- claudio is vulcan version of benedick
	- the deal is that claudio (same as in MFM) has to die (in the vulcAnised timeline).
		- that claudio is then going to become the one that apparently dies, yet the other one lives on.
	- the way to kill claudio seems to be hero.
- hero is the solar girl (ie, juliet) and claudio is romeo. her father is leonato (lion, the solar king -- ie, mercury)
- however there is a diversion: don john convinces claudio of hero's infidelity, claiming that this is well-prevented plague (once we've seen the sequel: (probably) LLL).
	- simply put, this "infidelity" of hero seemingly caused 
- "don pedro" is the name of peter of castille, but his descriptions are not of him. don pedro is described a vulcan version of peter:
	- "I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself." (I wish bea had bestowed her incredible wisdom on pedro, making him her soul-mate) [the strange thing about this line is that it assumes bea is a solar type girl, too. it's quite possible that bea and hero are different aspects to the same, like claudio and benedick]
- "don john" is (in the play) don pedro's "bastard" brother. peter was the illigitmate heir to maria of portugal (meaning he's the bastard) to alfonso-11, so therefore don john/pedro are essentially the same person.
	- bea/hero
	- benedick/claudio
	- don pedro/john

### 2023-12-24 09:15 - connecting a lot of pieces together

each play has *ultra suggestive* language that describes pretty young girls losing their virginity; and an extreme emphasis on the visuals that the man will acquire from her "loving eye". the entire play is very visual, and very targetted to the vulcans. I'm watching love's labours' lost, and (btw this is a total tragedy from inside-out perspective) the proposition is that these guys "give up their books" and try out one of these young virgin women, instead.
at this point, it's possible to go into two directions: (I'll go both), that mars is building up the imaginations of these enkidu to "fall down" into physicality. they get so enamoured with them visually, they simply cannot help theirselves, as their desire for phsicality is great. this sudden apparition of these vulcans on to planet earth, is essentially the bronze-age-collapse in a nutshell, as well. they build up some big narrative with a bunch of desiarable stuff: plunder, women, etc. -- but mostly women. the women are just the bait that the earth has to get these guys to show up. mars is just the salesman (not salesperson). he's advertising that they fall into physicality, and not remain in their imaginations for a while. it's kinda a bait though, because as love always is, it's not predictable, and so all emotions that resonate get amplified, so that the initial glow when her sexual eyes are opened, evntually wears off to the mundane reality which doesn't feel quite the same. romance is supposed to keep her pumped up about these guys, but that's a losing battle, because there are only so many ways that someone unwilling to improve can be laughed at or excused for his behaviour. what's worse, is we try to maintain all of these awful ideas like everyone, always is automatically born a sinner, and need punishment already from day one, etc.
the other way I forgot now. let me see if I czn rhemember it. there ix an extreme emphasis on the visuals that the man will acquire from these young virgins... ah yes: now it's possible to perceive that from the feminine side of things, it's a competition, and since there's such little good catches out there, this is sort of a fixer-upper sort of idea: they now have something to improve that's outside of them. these romances are a giant excuse to say that bad and lustful behaviour is all just fine, and that the women actually like the extra problems that men bring. behind that outer facade is the underlying motivation: girls are extremely way better than men are at most everything -- but they're so busy looking outside of theirselves (needing men, etc.) they never realise their potential. so, to avoid a society with a bunch of very powerful women, teach them to look outside of theirselves and enjoy the fixer-uppers. it's a peevish circle, that one.

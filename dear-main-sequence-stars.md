in my own personal life, I've noticed a growing displeasure towards 2nd ray girls. although they're really great and fun and stuff, there are a lot of symbolic things that we disagree on, considerably (the same with venus). the problem does have remedy though, which is to go inside-out as a vulcan (-5+) and *receive* all of that amazing concept/emotion in reflection of the relation that I have in my *perception*.
	we all have a brain, so we all have a relational mechanism, from which we extrapolate symbol (always, never, if, while, etc). I don't want to im9ose a 2nd ray relational system on anyone. I do it here when I write, but I try to keep my editing to a minimum and the ability for more than one angle of the concept to be seen. I try to write more conceptually, than I do symbolically. I have OK grammar, and I communicate pretty clearly, so the variation in the symbol only allows for more angles Of the concept to be seen. I *like* that others relate things differently than I do. I do not want to impose (like a main sequence star does) a relational mechanism on anyone, which is why I'm vulcan-like (-5+), especially when I'm writing here. I put out the concept and I explain the relations in symbol, but ultimately everyone makes their own relations. I don't impose on the child to automatically believe that som5 saviour is cominv and whatever problem is going to be taken care of. it may be the case that could happen, but I don't assert that relation and tie it to (definitely gonna happen: foretold/prophecy/etc) into anyone's experience. I paint a conceptual picture that is as vivid as I can, and then allow anyone and everyone to interpret it how they wish.
	it's quite possible that advancements in our ability to communicate conceptually (a technology I've wanted to make -- meaning a symbolic representation of concept) could make it no loger even necessary to communicate symbolically. therefore, I've really gone away from 2nd ray perception, almost entirely. I want to move to a system where it's possible for anyone to see whatever they want to see in m/ writings. I mean that so that when I write, not only is it more convenient to write the concept in a more expansive way, each person will individually relate to the concept through their own 2nd ray mechanism (brain, or AI, whatever).
therefore when a star, or a person is inside-out like this, power levels are controlled (or at least mine are), so tthat I don't ever get a really fast visual/symbolic experience, so instead I receivce all of that concept directly then. in the future, (cause I'll have the same system) we'll have the capacity to make symbols (like atoms and molecules and stuff) from the concept that we're utilising. this means everything from shapes4ifting to having a whole c6nc5ptual army within their capabilities. that's an esssential necessity for a star, which produces atoms and stuff -- so from the resident on earth, the appearance is exactly the same: just signals come toward the sun, instead of out of like main sequence stars do.
having the ability to have her hydrogen outputting into things like atoms and stuff, means that the star can now look like whatever it wants to (and can even be earth-like). there are quite a few advantages to the conceptual model.

### 2024-02-04 15:19 - attractive vs emissive light

the majority of stars are these main-sequence-stars: 2nd ray in perception, which means that in addition to being highly receptive, they also emit very strongly in these 2nd ray (very subatomic) frequencies. opposite to isis, is the vulcan: he can do everything that she does, just alter the frequency of the light, on its way *inward*. we have one such system on earth, and is what constitutes the crust of the earth, and stars can use a very similar system to generate atoms and molecules on the surface for the solar wind.
	the earth is a reflective system, in that there's as much outside as there is inside, but obviously not all vulcans can be this way: we reflect very dimly of our outer universe. this is quite good, and what makes being a "foil" so much better: a foil takes in some amount of conceptual input frequency/light, and then turns it into something symbolic (ie atoms, narrative, words, etc.) a reflection must always return a very similar output to their input, but a good foil can essentially absorb everything, and then output/transform that energy into whatever they need for the output. like, I'm physically pretty good at it too, because I can eat almost anythting, and my system just absorbs it. I'm fairly certain that I could continue on eating more and more crazy things, and it's not a problem for me. in addition to that, eventually I want to get to the point that it doesn't matter whatever input it is, I can transform it right straight-away into something wanted.
	the cool thing about everyone having attractive light is that we all get light from everyone else, and so my transformers are conatantly finding more ways to transform others' input light into the symbolic system I want output (like every vulcan, lol).
	the other cool thing is that no longer am I imposing on anyone anything that they don't attract -- but at the same time, there's a continual increase in diversity because of others constantly outputting different things. so instead of there being a dominant outputter disrupting others' desire to individuate, now the constant outputter is everyone, and it's forcing individuation (ie, I receive so much light, but I prefer to output on these frequencies, in these ways). (brb)

### 2024-02-06 09:19 - (untitled)

the last few days I've been trying to figure out what in the world is it that I *actually* want. to explain why I'm saying this, consider the objective that I have in mind: I want to make sex, enegetically inert/powerless. the reason why I want to do that is because it's too powerful, and (like a star) it's an emissive thing -- meaning I'm influencing others lives just cause I want to have some pleasure. I don't want to influence others lives, and I *do not* want to set the next "solar regime" (which is the structure the whole solar system lives inside of), because then that would mean me asserting the way that I think and see reality, on everyone else. I don't want to do that -- and it's already pretty obvious that nosebook is working so hard to ensure that nobody gets my form of perception (without paying for it, I'm sure), so they don't want others having it. they don't even want me to have it -- and I don't want to have it either. it's a 2nd ray form of perception which is quite powerful -- which under that solar regime, they would have to gain my levels of non-resistance to get it, which is considerable, because right now they can just get it for free. I don't mind that they have it for free because it benefits me greatly. I also don't want it, because it's *emissive* and I want to have an *attractive* relationship to other people.
	essentially my read on the way stars are setup now goes something like this: they're a bunch of high-minded women that know how to evolve hominid species by simply giving one side (through sex with solar girls) some kind of perceptual advantage. that gets the guys all fired up over these solar girls, and they start competing between one another for them -- that causes conflict and wars start to happpen (illiad is most well-known for this) -- which then works out in their favour because the hominid species has to eventully evolve into something more than a warlord tweaked out on these girls' perception. it's a tried and true formula: just throw enough girls at the problem, and these guys eventually turn it around. I get that it works, but it's a process that is quite assertive, much like a star is. it's really helpful that a solar regime can ensure that life is possible, and that conscious life is inevitable. those things are fine, but the idea that everyone has to abide by the same rules, is sorta cumbersome.
	take the earth for example, and notice that anyone can be any way they want on the planet. one island on one side of the earth can have entirely different behaviour and social interaction from another place on the opposite sides. we only consider the idea of a "globalised society" because this is what the solar power structures are proposing; they want the same thing: one regim5 where everyone is under the regime and has to work within it. that's the 3rd ray aspect to a 2nd ray system -- which I believe is not necessary.
what I've done is I've turned this whole relationship inside out. I've been going on for a bit now, my plan to only use 1-5-7 rays as my access into reality. I don't think I want or need them, and they're quite cumbersome. I can do everything symbolic that I need to do, conceptually, and that's an *attractive* system: I just attract the answer that I'm looking for. I consider this to be quite an improvement, and don't want to have anything to do with 2nd ray. if I were to go 2nd ray, I would dominate and destroy everything that I didn't like and turn the world into what I want -- which is why I refuse to go 2nd ray. I refuse to interact with these solar girls (cause I don't want to see like they do), and I don't want to impose my vibration onto anyone else.
	there is a bit of a problem -- which I don't think is that much of a problem: I want to go completely conceptual: attract the light that I want, then turn that into atoms and real physical stuff -- but these guys do not want that for me either. they want me to stay in a symbolic system where they control everything -- which will last about as long as it can last. so there is considerable effort to try and keep me in a symbolic system, which is an assertive system, which is a bit problematic because without being given the option to become attractive, they're forcing me to turn the world into something I want to live in, and everyone else is sorta along for the ride. there's nothing I can do about it. they *will not* allow me to become attractive.
	sure, the easy road out of this situation I'm in, is just to find a solar girl, setup a new solar regime, and then they're forced to live in my world already, as it is -- but I will not go for that, because *on principle*, I cannot do such a thing. sure, I could try and figure out a way to make it all attraction once I've setup a solar regime, but that's like saying "I had to kill a bunch of people to save a bunch of others" -- and I say to that: "I don't save anyone; they attracted their problem, and I'm not going to save them or anyone else."
	there is a bit of a poetic irony to them forcing me to be symbolically emissive, because I can't use attraction, which means that my own desire to live in a place I want to live in (that models LOA), they're literally clobbering theirself with their own attempts to force me to use an assertive system.
so, I'm proposing to the main-sequence-stars at large, to strongly consider an attractive/conceptual star type. the earth is such a system, and it works well. everyone can be different, and it's OK.
	I won't ever be able to convince the guys the parasites running my body to allow me to use an attractive system, so then, I figure I can perhaps appeal to the ones that are really running the show.

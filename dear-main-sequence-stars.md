in my own personal life, I've noticed a growing displeasure towards 2nd ray girls. although they're really great and fun and stuff, there are a lot of symbolic things that we disagree on, considerably (the same with venus). the problem does have remedy though, which is to go inside-out as a vulcan (-5+) and *receive* all of that amazing concept/emotion in reflection of the relation that I have in my *perception*.
	we all have a brain, so we all have a relational mechanism, from which we extrapolate symbol (always, never, if, while, etc). I don't want to im9ose a 2nd ray relational system on anyone. I do it here when I write, but I try to keep my editing to a minimum and the ability for more than one angle of the concept to be seen. I try to write more conceptually, than I do symbolically. I have OK grammar, and I communicate pretty clearly, so the variation in the symbol only allows for more angles Of the concept to be seen. I *like* that others relate things differently than I do. I do not want to impose (like a main sequence star does) a relational mechanism on anyone, which is why I'm vulcan-like (-5+), especially when I'm writing here. I put out the concept and I explain the relations in symbol, but ultimately everyone makes their own relations. I don't impose on the child to automatically believe that som5 saviour is cominv and whatever problem is going to be taken care of. it may be the case that could happen, but I don't assert that relation and tie it to (definitely gonna happen: foretold/prophecy/etc) into anyone's experience. I paint a conceptual picture that is as vivid as I can, and then allow anyone and everyone to interpret it how they wish.
	it's quite possible that advancements in our ability to communicate conceptually (a technology I've wanted to make -- meaning a symbolic representation of concept) could make it no loger even necessary to communicate symbolically. therefore, I've really gone away from 2nd ray perception, almost entirely. I want to move to a system where it's possible for anyone to see whatever they want to see in m/ writings. I mean that so that when I write, not only is it more convenient to write the concept in a more expansive way, each person will individually relate to the concept through their own 2nd ray mechanism (brain, or AI, whatever).
therefore when a star, or a person is inside-out like this, power levels are controlled (or at least mine are), so tthat I don't ever get a really fast visual/symbolic experience, so instead I receivce all of that concept directly then. in the future, (cause I'll have the same system) we'll have the capacity to make symbols (like atoms and molecules and stuff) from the concept that we're utilising. this means everything from shapes4ifting to having a whole c6nc5ptual army within their capabilities. that's an esssential necessity for a star, which produces atoms and stuff -- so from the resident on earth, the appearance is exactly the same: just signals come toward the sun, instead of out of like main sequence stars do.
having the ability to have her hydrogen outputting into things like atoms and stuff, means that the star can now look like whatever it wants to (and can even be earth-like). there are quite a few advantages to the conceptual model.

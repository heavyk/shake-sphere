### 2024-02-04 12:09 - better option

in my own personal life, I've noticed a growing displeasure towards 2nd ray girls. although they're really great and fun and stuff, there are a lot of symbolic things that we disagree on, considerably (the same with venus). the problem does have remedy though, which is to go inside-out as a vulcan (-5+) and *receive* all of that amazing concept/emotion in reflection of the relation that I have in my *perception*.
	we all have a brain, so we all have a relational mechanism, from which we extrapolate symbol (always, never, if, while, etc). I don't want to im9ose a 2nd ray relational system on anyone. I do it here when I write, but I try to keep my editing to a minimum and the ability for more than one angle of the concept to be seen. I try to write more conceptually, than I do symbolically. I have OK grammar, and I communicate pretty clearly, so the variation in the symbol only allows for more angles Of the concept to be seen. I *like* that others relate things differently than I do. I do not want to impose (like a main sequence star does) a relational mechanism on anyone, which is why I'm vulcan-like (-5+), especially when I'm writing here. I put out the concept and I explain the relations in symbol, but ultimately everyone makes their own relations. I don't impose on the child to automatically believe that som5 saviour is cominv and whatever problem is going to be taken care of. it may be the case that could happen, but I don't assert that relation and tie it to (definitely gonna happen: foretold/prophecy/etc) into anyone's experience. I paint a conceptual picture that is as vivid as I can, and then allow anyone and everyone to interpret it how they wish.
	it's quite possible that advancements in our ability to communicate conceptually (a technology I've wanted to make -- meaning a symbolic representation of concept) could make it no loger even necessary to communicate symbolically. therefore, I've really gone away from 2nd ray perception, almost entirely. I want to move to a system where it's possible for anyone to see whatever they want to see in m/ writings. I mean that so that when I write, not only is it more convenient to write the concept in a more expansive way, each person will individually relate to the concept through their own 2nd ray mechanism (brain, or AI, whatever).
therefore when a star, or a person is inside-out like this, power levels are controlled (or at least mine are), so tthat I don't ever get a really fast visual/symbolic experience, so instead I receivce all of that concept directly then. in the future, (cause I'll have the same system) we'll have the capacity to make symbols (like atoms and molecules and stuff) from the concept that we're utilising. this means everything from shapes4ifting to having a whole c6nc5ptual army within their capabilities. that's an esssential necessity for a star, which produces atoms and stuff -- so from the resident on earth, the appearance is exactly the same: just signals come toward the sun, instead of out of like main sequence stars do.
having the ability to have her hydrogen outputting into things like atoms and stuff, means that the star can now look like whatever it wants to (and can even be earth-like). there are quite a few advantages to the conceptual model.

### 2024-02-04 15:19 - attractive vs emissive light

the majority of stars are these main-sequence-stars: 2nd ray in perception, which means that in addition to being highly receptive, they also emit very strongly in these 2nd ray (very subatomic) frequencies. opposite to isis, is the vulcan: he can do everything that she does, just alter the frequency of the light, on its way *inward*. we have one such system on earth, and is what constitutes the crust of the earth, and stars can use a very similar system to generate atoms and molecules on the surface for the solar wind.
	the earth is a reflective system, in that there's as much outside as there is inside, but obviously not all vulcans can be this way: we reflect very dimly of our outer universe. this is quite good, and what makes being a "foil" so much better: a foil takes in some amount of conceptual input frequency/light, and then turns it into something symbolic (ie atoms, narrative, words, etc.) a reflection must always return a very similar output to their input, but a good foil can essentially absorb everything, and then output/transform that energy into whatever they need for the output. like, I'm physically pretty good at it too, because I can eat almost anythting, and my system just absorbs it. I'm fairly certain that I could continue on eating more and more crazy things, and it's not a problem for me. in addition to that, eventually I want to get to the point that it doesn't matter whatever input it is, I can transform it right straight-away into something wanted.
	the cool thing about everyone having attractive light is that we all get light from everyone else, and so my transformers are conatantly finding more ways to transform others' input light into the symbolic system I want output (like every vulcan, lol).
	the other cool thing is that no longer am I imposing on anyone anything that they don't attract -- but at the same time, there's a continual increase in diversity because of others constantly outputting different things. so instead of there being a dominant outputter disrupting others' desire to individuate, now the constant outputter is everyone, and it's forcing individuation (ie, I receive so much light, but I prefer to output on these frequencies, in these ways). (brb)

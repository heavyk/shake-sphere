# love's labour's lost (her mind)

### 2023-12-26 05:19 - as you like it?

I had a few dreams last night about love's labour's lost (2000). I *really* like that film, and it's had a strong impact on me. as I mentioned previously, I really don't like the idea of "getting back/even" with the boys. sure, the girls have been living in this symbolically narrative reality for quite a long time (since the beginning of Time?), but I don't think it's *all* bad -- and even some good aspects as well. the difficulty I have with getting back/even is just that: it requires a position (as in, now I'm in front, so I have to get back) or it requires an equals sign, where once there was inequality between two sides, adding the equals sign will somehow even it up -- which can never actually happe: literally, it would mean all stars galaxies, planets, people, etc. would be smashed into an infinitely tiny spec in the middle of the universe, and no life would exist -- so kinda bad if everything were equal. I much prefer the LOA system, where everything is based around *attraction* or receptivity. boys in general (and I definitely struggled with this for a while) have an idea that they need to go out and conquer what it is that they need. this idea of asserting/emitting to get what's wanted is (IMO) *inferior* to just attracting what's wanted.
	as an example of hunting or assertion, in the poem of venus and adonis, adonis is out hunting to get what he wants, which is quite necessary in early stages of primate development (for carnivores anyway), and since meat is a tremendously more dense source of protein, it means that the primate doesn't have to spend nearly all of the day eating vegetables. hunting for meat is much more efficient and a step in the process, toward becoming a self realised animal, but I'd say that hunting probably isn't the end goal, especially once growing protein technology becomes available, or the body is capable of getting most of its nutrients directly from the sun.
I don't want to get rid of narrative and to say it's bad, because I think it's kinda fun; and I believe that narrative actually has some surprising elements to it, because narrative never actually turns out the way that it's said it'll turn out (unless of course everyone understands the symbols the same and also completely believes the narrative), which means that narrative (because of the shifting aspect of symbols) has quite a degree of uncertainty to it (on the symbolic level). however, from the desire/attraction (conceptual) standpoint, there isn't really a whole lot of uncertainty at all. the narrative is telling how characters in different positions and social strata are going to feel and react in different situations, and so the author of the narrative is essentially saying: if I'm in this situation with these conditions, this is how I should be treated and how I should feel about myself: which is of course a concept. the next part of the narrative is symbolically associating the protagonist (or antagonist) to myself the author. this association is to ensure that I (the author) end up in the social strata and the conditions that I want to be in: which is of course 2nd ray perception. therefore, we can think of narrative, not as a symbolic system whereby, people are put into their place, and an unbalanced system always returns back to equilibrium as soon as all of the "bad" forces are removed or neutralised by the "good" forces.

so, the idea that came to me this morning after waking up was the following: what if we combined the plots of "as you like it" (AYLI) and "love's labour's lost" (LLL). first, notice in LLL that the girls want to "get back" at the boys and reveal to their their own misbehaviour -- which is then calculated in the form of action. this is the symbolic way of doing things, and is (IMO), the reason why this play is a tragedy: it teaches girls, that their way to "get back/even" is to calculate a way to retaliate the opponent. thousands of years of watching nation state after nation state getting back at their enemies, shows us that this style of punishment does not really teach the punished one to change their ways. it really only creates fear/depression, which then turns into feelings of anger/revenge as they try to take their power back. so, when going up the emotional scale like that, don't just stop at revenge and start making action there, but keep going all the way up to feeling good -- and let the enemy punish theirselves with their own attraction. it I make actions when I'm not feeling good, I'm attracting more situations that feel like the not-good way I feel, so they, trying to limit someone into a symbolic system where they're disempowered, is attracting for them exactly that: a new symbolic regime in which they're disimpowered. there's no need to try and fix them at all. they can figure it out all on their own, as they begin to realise that all reality (even the narrated one) is *received* by the concepts/emotions the attractor is focused on.
	this, I believe is the tactic for "getting back" that should be taken instead (essentially non-action): just let them figure it out, and for all of the girls that feel they need to punish someone -- fine, let them do it, because they're only punishing theirselves in the long-run, anyway. in fact, I would even guess that most all of the stuff that they hate about the boys, they theirselves also are doing (or would do if given the chance).
now then, the obvious elephant in the solar system is the sun: the sun (as I experience her) has a lot of different ideas about self-sacrifice (like, if I become less, then the greater good can come out) and comparison/competition/chivalry/rivalry which is actually continuing to support the conditional part of the narrative (every logical operation: if,while,for,when,until,etc. all start with a comparison), and those comparisons are all necessary for symbolic belief systems to continue (like "if I become less, then something else can become more") -- when they're not really necessary. I envision a time when the sun perceives in a slightly diffrent way: more in the form of pure-desire: "how do I want to feel" -- and the result will be the same (they become more), but doesn't require the sacrifice on my part of becoming less. instead, I just find a way to feel good about whatever, no matter what they're doing, and they get a reflection of their own desire/fear back to them (as narratively defined by them). as the sun moves from more from the bottom of the 2nd ray perspective (I want to get back at the boys for holding me in symbolic bondage (not their fault, because I believed the narrative, which is what kept me in the prison, not them)) then shifts up more and more into the conceptual/desire range of things: how do I want to feel? (cause what I feel is what I'm *attracting*).
in AYLI, the plot is set sometime into the future of today (I figure about ~50y from now), and in the plot we can think of "rowland de boys" as the kingdom of the boys: the symbolic kingdom where there are kings and rulers and wrestling matches and proving oneself (boy stuff). in the play, I like to think of celia (-7) and rosalind (-2/-5+) representing not just girls from dukedoms, but as stars. now, when I consider rosalind as representing the traditional -2 (narrative) form of perception, the goal is to get her to start to head in the direction of more and more attraction (-1): how do I feel; which then places the triad of orlando, celia, and rosalind to have a transition: celia, (like the crust of the earth) remains how she is, but rosalind and orlando swap positions kinda: rosalind (now -1) is more like the centre of the earth, and orlando is now the new prometheus (+2). the story ends on a happy note (with everyone getting married), but orlando is headed for a pretty big crash soon, and will need to become 2nd ray receptive, instead of trying to wrestle everyone for position as most powerful. the story has a lot of "epic of gilgamesh" in it, and so he too may have to find his enkidu a little later on. I dunno what he'll narrate for himself, but he's in an extremely precarious position the way he's going. (brb)

# love's labour's lost (her mind)

### 2023-12-26 05:19 - as you like it?

I had a few dreams last night about love's labour's lost (2000). I *really* like that film, and it's had a strong impact on me. as I mentioned previously, I really don't like the idea of "getting back/even" with the boys. sure, the girls have been living in this symbolically narrative reality for quite a long time (since the beginning of Time?), but I don't think it's *all* bad -- and even some good aspects as well. the difficulty I have with getting back/even is just that: it requires a position (as in, now I'm in front, so I have to get back) or it requires an equals sign, where once there was inequality between two sides, adding the equals sign will somehow even it up -- which can never actually happe: literally, it would mean all stars galaxies, planets, people, etc. would be smashed into an infinitely tiny spec in the middle of the universe, and no life would exist -- so kinda bad if everything were equal. I much prefer the LOA system, where everything is based around *attraction* or receptivity. boys in general (and I definitely struggled with this for a while) have an idea that they need to go out and conquer what it is that they need. this idea of asserting/emitting to get what's wanted is (IMO) *inferior* to just attracting what's wanted.
	as an example of hunting or assertion, in the poem of venus and adonis, adonis is out hunting to get what he wants, which is quite necessary in early stages of primate development (for carnivores anyway), and since meat is a tremendously more dense source of protein, it means that the primate doesn't have to spend nearly all of the day eating vegetables. hunting for meat is much more efficient and a step in the process, toward becoming a self realised animal, but I'd say that hunting probably isn't the end goal, especially once growing protein technology becomes available, or the body is capable of getting most of its nutrients directly from the sun.
I don't want to get rid of narrative and to say it's bad, because I think it's kinda fun; and I believe that narrative actually has some surprising elements to it, because narrative never actually turns out the way that it's said it'll turn out (unless of course everyone understands the symbols the same and also completely believes the narrative), which means that narrative (because of the shifting aspect of symbols) has quite a degree of uncertainty to it (on the symbolic level). however, from the desire/attraction (conceptual) standpoint, there isn't really a whole lot of uncertainty at all. the narrative is telling how characters in different positions and social strata are going to feel and react in different situations, and so the author of the narrative is essentially saying: if I'm in this situation with these conditions, this is how I should be treated and how I should feel about myself: which is of course a concept. the next part of the narrative is symbolically associating the protagonist (or antagonist) to myself the author. this association is to ensure that I (the author) end up in the social strata and the conditions that I want to be in: which is of course 2nd ray perception. therefore, we can think of narrative, not as a symbolic system whereby, people are put into their place, and an unbalanced system always returns back to equilibrium as soon as all of the "bad" forces are removed or neutralised by the "good" forces.

so, the idea that came to me this morning after waking up was the following: what if we combined the plots of "as you like it" (AYLI) and "love's labour's lost" (LLL). first, notice in LLL that the girls want to "get back" at the boys and reveal to their their own misbehaviour -- which is then calculated in the form of action. this is the symbolic way of doing things, and is (IMO), the reason why this play is a tragedy: it teaches girls, that their way to "get back/even" is to calculate a way to retaliate the opponent. thousands of years of watching nation state after nation state getting back at their enemies, shows us that this style of punishment does not really teach the punished one to change their ways. it really only creates fear/depression, which then turns into feelings of anger/revenge as they try to take their power back. so, when going up the emotional scale like that, don't just stop at revenge and start making action there, but keep going all the way up to feeling good -- and let the enemy punish theirselves with their own attraction. it I make actions when I'm not feeling good, I'm attracting more situations that feel like the not-good way I feel, so they, trying to limit someone into a symbolic system where they're disempowered, is attracting for them exactly that: a new symbolic regime in which they're disimpowered. there's no need to try and fix them at all. they can figure it out all on their own, as they begin to realise that all reality (even the narrated one) is *received* by the concepts/emotions the attractor is focused on.
	this, I believe is the tactic for "getting back" that should be taken instead (essentially non-action): just let them figure it out, and for all of the girls that feel they need to punish someone -- fine, let them do it, because they're only punishing theirselves in the long-run, anyway. in fact, I would even guess that most all of the stuff that they hate about the boys, they theirselves also are doing (or would do if given the chance).
now then, the obvious elephant in the solar system is the sun: the sun (as I experience her) has a lot of different ideas about self-sacrifice (like, if I become less, then the greater good can come out) and comparison/competition/chivalry/rivalry which is actually continuing to support the conditional part of the narrative (every logical operation: if,while,for,when,until,etc. all start with a comparison), and those comparisons are all necessary for symbolic belief systems to continue (like "if I become less, then something else can become more") -- when they're not really necessary. I envision a time when the sun perceives in a slightly diffrent way: more in the form of pure-desire: "how do I want to feel" -- and the result will be the same (they become more), but doesn't require the sacrifice on my part of becoming less. instead, I just find a way to feel good about whatever, no matter what they're doing, and they get a reflection of their own desire/fear back to them (as narratively defined by them). as the sun moves from more from the bottom of the 2nd ray perspective (I want to get back at the boys for holding me in symbolic bondage (not their fault, because I believed the narrative, which is what kept me in the prison, not them)) then shifts up more and more into the conceptual/desire range of things: how do I want to feel? (cause what I feel is what I'm *attracting*).
in AYLI, the plot is set sometime into the future of today (I figure about ~50y from now, if symbolically I'm adam), and in the plot we can think of "rowland de boys" as the kingdom of the boys: the symbolic kingdom where there are kings and rulers and wrestling matches and proving oneself (boy stuff). in the play, I like to think of celia (-7) and rosalind (-2/-5+) representing not just girls from dukedoms, but as stars. now, when I consider rosalind as representing the traditional -2 (narrative) form of perception, the goal is to get her to start to head in the direction of more and more attraction (-1): how do I feel; which then places the triad of orlando, celia, and rosalind to have a transition: celia, (like the crust of the earth) remains how she is, but rosalind and orlando swap positions kinda: rosalind (now -1) is more like the centre of the earth, and orlando is now the new prometheus (+2). the story ends on a happy note (with everyone getting married), but orlando is headed for a pretty big crash soon, and will need to become 2nd ray receptive, instead of trying to wrestle everyone for position as most powerful. the story has a lot of "epic of gilgamesh" in it, and so he too may have to find his enkidu a little later on. I dunno what he'll narrate for himself, but he's in an extremely precarious position the way he's going. (brb 07:32)
therefore, I propose that we delay the start of the new solar regime for as long as possible. on way that it's narrated is in the tragedy of romeo and juliet. wait for her to become at least 18yo. then the next narration is the one that I like the most: boomin' grannies (a song by the beastie boys that I particularly liked and their anthology album plays a pretty significant role in the narrative that I started out with). in the song, it says "I don't really care if you're 50 or 74" -- which, I don't really think that age is very much of a problem, because the goal is for her to learn how to feel the way she wants to feel, which means that she'll look about the age that she feels. I do not want to make any predictions on how she'll feel, but I will say that conditions will probably be pretty good, and apart for any competition or comparison that she potentially feels with any of the other girls, she should feel pretty vibrant and *alive*. I imagine she'll be very very attractive. we don't have to stick to the narrative though, and I imagine as time passes by, we'll have a better understanding about the details. the goal of waiting for so long though, is to establish a few new technologies during that time, and make it so that the her 2nd ray perception is less in the symbolic end of the spectrum, and more in the conceptual/desire end of the spectrum; and, if at all possible (like we have the technology capability to do it), I want to make her as much of a 1st ray perception as possible while still retaining symbolic capabilities (something that I myself am mastering right now, and would like to pass on to as many as desire it).
	also in this interim time, I want to work on a few technologoies. one of the things that helped me to understand LOA was actually software development, team management/leadership, and data flow/storage/querying. these were all very enlightening to me, because they helped me to realise how limited the symbolic world is. our brains are able to query and retrive data in a way that no database can presently do, and databases can query data in a way that my brain cannot do. the brain does not return discreet values and records like a database does, but a spectrum of relevant/relating concepts (much more like an AI).
		the distinction between the two is roughly the difference between conceptual and symbolic logic. the difference is most greatly perceived when dealing with the spectral (4) layer of perception -- because the answers one seeks their are all translated by the brain into *both* a concept which feels like the answer, and the brain's symbolic (usually with a picture) representation of that concept. the difficulty is that concepts do not have any hard edges to them; they are literally a spectrum or gradient of more and less resonant, so when the brain translates the cOncept into something symbolic, it usually loses the "certainty" or "probability" that symbol accurately represents the thing (the comparison is the feeling of the the imagined symbol vs the feeling of the original concept).
	I have begun to build up a lot of different ideas for a fully cOnceptual computing system, whereby data can be queried similar to how the brain does it -- but that's for stage two of the project: relevancy/relational filters/aggregators. before that happens, I want to completely invert the present way that technology is perceived: interface items will go from pull/poll to push, and data will go from query (difinitive/symbolic) to query (relevance), upon which all data (which become concepts) get displayed according to the user's definition(s) of the concept: no more standarised  (one size fits all) presentation anymore -- as we begin to transition into seeing only what we *want* to see in our symbolic/communication systems.
this transition of allowing technology to present us with what we want to see (instead of what is symbolically), I believe goes hand-in-hand with the same transition that I want to make with the solar regime, and the re-definition of narrative by adding 4 additional perceptive layers. the symbolic part is a means to an end, but not the end itself. the end is seeing what we want to see, and allowing technology to give us exactly that: the ultimate matrix; the ultra-natural (lol).
anyway, my plans for technology I think will help to make a smoothe transition for all of the venus girls, as it'll be a lot easier to understand attraction when we can use these interfaces In a symbolic way, and come to find out that all symbolic systems (even the narrated ones) eventually show us ourselves. technology is a mirror, much like a psychedellic. I know I sound and feel a bit strong-willed about my ideas, and forcing the boys to live in a world of attraction *is* their ultimate fear (and so therefore can be thought of as punishment), but also it's my greatest desire, too. I *want* to live in a world of only attraction, where I'm only getting what I want (all of the time). technology can then be thought of as an incarnation of the 2nd ray perspective, and so I figure we should use the attractive side too, and not *only* the symbolic side (as it is presently). I don't believe we should abandon symbolic percEption in any way, because that's how we can tell what is one thing and not another. it helps us to define borders, good and bad, light and dark; it's the contrast between one thing and another -- or, how one thing feels in relation to another. that perspective is magnificent, as now everything is just the defference between things in how they sound/feel one to another; polarities no longer exist as everything feels like everything else in one way or another.

### 2023-12-30 17:28 - masking and seeing what I want to see

in LLL, there is this scene where the girls find out that they're going to be tried to be woo'd, even though the "competitors in oath" have all sworn not to get into contact with women. so, because they're being deceived by the boys (and they received some pretty lame gifts), they decide that when the boys show up, they will switch masks, that is the symbolic shroud that surrounds a person, so that they will carry the symbol of another one of the girls. I noticed the reason for that (because it fits into my plan of wanting to add 4 more layers), but the motive is a bit strange: let me illuminate.
presently in my current situation, it's possible for me to see astral in my eyes, and I accomplished it a few times when in spain. however, there is strong resistance against me seeing astral, which at first I fought, but now have come to favour. 7 layers will be expanded to 11, but because I'm prevented (and neither want it), I'll limit my perception to only 9 of them (9/11 layers, yes...) this is the plan, and I have no intention of deviating from it.
	one interesting thing about not seeing the shroud that I learned later, is that quite a few people have this shroud about them, and others see it. they use it to do jujas and other methods of convincing based on appearance. the thing is, I don't see their shroud though, so I have no idea what on earth they're doing a lot of times. I could tell something was up because on numerous occasions, especially when dominant men were arguing, their body motions and essence appeared to me like a primate, throwing feces at one another, bopping the other guy in the head so he knows his spot -- three stooges stuff. now, whether or not they were *actually* doing those chimp-like movements or not, I can't be certain (probably not), and my running theory on that is that they are all seeing the shroud (the symbolic mask that covers and shapes their physical body according to the symbol they project), but because I don't see astral, all I see is their physical bodies along with all of the extra emotional data that I "see". when they emit a symbol like that, they also emit an emotion: for example, imagine one says, "que no lo hagas, vale?" and at the same time they're emitting the symbol that the other person's behaviour is not proper within the *code* of *conduct* -- and, because they're someone of *authority*, then that behaviour will not be tolerated. well, for me, I don't see any of the symbols I *highlighted*; instead, I feel the emotion of their upsetness with the behaviour, and then the coersion feeling that they make when they're trying to establish that someone should do the "right thing", and then the power and authority feeling that they're projecting out to establish themselves as the motivation for the other person's change of action. for me, the whole sequence of emotions plays out something like one chimpanzee going to pick at something on another of the chimpanzees, he gets mad and doesn't want to be touched, so he throws his arms up, waves them around and starts making an unpleasant sound (kinda like honking a horn). I don't see the chimps in 3d space, but they're there (in feeling) just as if I were in the zoo watching them.
	that example is a bit unfair because I don't usually "see" others as primitive beings, but instead I usually "see" a person in a much more positive light than (usually) they can even see of theirselves. in short: I see what I *want* to see (that which makes most conceptual sense to my brain) because I don't like looking at ugly people -- so I prefer to see them as the concept that they are, but their brain's concept of theirself (ie, how they perceive the world, which is a reflection of theirself) limits them from feeling the concept that I can see. this capacity is, btw, the way that jesus healed people: he saw them (visually in his case) as being not broken; so in a sense he was putting a symbolic shroud over the people he's "healing" (their "healing" is just allowing theirself seeing themselves the way he sees them). I've done this a few times (sometimes by accident and a few times on purpose), and my experience is that it doesn't work out too well, because then they come to depend on me to see them the way they want to see theirselves. I do not want to engage in that type of interaction with others (especially girls). it does not bode well for me or for them in the long run.
so, because I'm getting better at "seeing" others the way I want to see them, my grand plan is to eventually go completely *blind* (as in, no longer use my eyes), because I want to completely rebuild the way that I perceive reality from a broad spectrum of sensors (I'll be pitch black, so everything), and then from there, I'll literally *only* and *always*, see what I want to see.
	I can feel that there is some objection to my desire, because a girl can often times spend a lot of time on her appearance, and then I never even see it. I just see what  I want to see and nevermind all of the effort she put into her appearance. if she's trying to impress someone else with how she looks, she'll have to impress someone other than me, because I only want to see what I want to see (which is usually better than how she looks, anyway). the other objection to this idea is the one where I will have gone all of this time getting all the way up to getting the "lover's eyes" that baron is so fond of and also using as motivation for giving up his *books*. I have never seen these shrouds that others like to present to each, and I probably never will; which is probably pretty detestable to visual people unlike myself.
here's the thing: these venus (-3) and jupiter (+3) types like to cast these appearances around theirselves, so they can use their appearance to get what they want [europa was laid on the principle of dishonest appearances], and if I can't or don't want to see their facade, then I'm very difficult for venus and zeus to manipulate me with their appearance. however, I have news to them: I've never been able to see the shroud, so I'm not really missing anything, and also I *like* it that I "see" their feeling/desire to manipulate me, instead of their masked appearance. (show the good parts and hide the bad)
	you know, *all* of the unfortunate things that happened to me in spain could have been avoided if I had've gone with what I "see" instead of the symbol (convincing words and a generally false feeling of security in my mind, generated from the symbolic presence that they're emitting: nothing is happening here, it's all OK... etc. -- the usual tricky business). by not *seeing* with my *eyes*, I actually see the situation clearer, than if I had the super graphics. I don't care how mind-blowing the graphics are, I'll pass. I'm sure I'll be able to design a new form of perception that superceeds astral in both quality and experience.

### 2023-12-31 06:53 - role reversals

there's this strange thing about this play, which has to do with role reversals. the play has a lot of resonances with AYLI, as well (where rosalind dresses up as ganymede for a while). the way that I interpret that has something to do with cosmology: I think the planet vulcan *does* exist, and it's probably not talked about because it's not outputting in visible wavelengths (perhaps some UV because some notably astrally perceptive men claimed to have seen it, but prolly only x-ray+), and so if that's the case, it's definitely going to be anything that we call a "planet", mostly because it's probably mostly or all hydrogen, which makes it much more like a star than a planet. therefore rosalind in native form would be a girl, rathar than a boy, but for a time, she dresses up as a boy ganymede.
I don't know if this play was written before or after "dido queen of carthage" (I assume after), but tthis play has a lot of resonances to DQOC; the explanation here (or at least the way I see it) is that marlowe and shakespere knew each other (both tops), and they were exploring in poetry the explanation for ganymede's insatiable desire; not too unlike that of a woman -- and they made various plays on the subject. DQOC is a tragedy about a vulcan in female form, and makes a very strong note of the contrast between vulcan in male form (ganymede being dandled on jupiter's knee in the beginning of the play) vs vulcan in female form (dido). the idea here is that although dido had a tragical trajectory to her, ultimately she's venerated as being beneficial to man's efforts.
	[note: I haven't seen a production of the play yet, and only have read parts of the script, so must of my knowledge of these things comes more from intuition, than from actual knowledge. I really liked DQOC every time I've read it, and there are a lot of really inteesting symbols in it as well].
however (as the play points out), as great as ganymede ultimately is, he's still subject to the whims of jupiter. now, cosmologically speaking, this makes perfect sense, because venus is a female improvement on jupiter (receptive and emissive), and so venus (being the third moon of the sun) will suck up all of vulcan's symbolic output, prohibiting things that are symbolically (calculated to be) undesirable from emanating out further into the solar system.
	anyway, that triad of thoth (+7), vulcan (-5+) and venus (-3) is quite an interesting one, because vulcan is turning concept into symbol, which is anything from words and thoughts, all the way to actually physical stuff like atoms and stuff. just as an asside, vulcan is quite an interesting archetype because the symbolic layer (3) is everything we know of as 4,6,7 (but not really 5) -- and the reason why the conceptual is so difficult to see for someone like saturn (+-4), venus (-3) and jupiter (+3) is because the concept is completely covered over by the astral (6) component (the shroud or mask that the girls put on to trick the boys). therefore, they see the physical shape, and are (usually) totally unaware of the feeling/concept (5) that produced what they viscerally see and experience. vulcan has no such resistances. so, in planetary form, vulcan cannot receive symbols (coming from the sun), because he has no physicality necessary for that (a hard rocky/carbon outer shell); however, in human form (male or female), vulcan has a brain and so therefore can also receive symbol. so, in human form, vulcan has the missing hole that everyone wants filled (-5 - cause everyone's looking for Love to fill their conceptual void) *AND* he's also able to emit symbol like jupiter and venus, as well. vulcan is a dramatic improvement, and (in human form) puts himself at the top, as the most capable of them all. in	fact, in human form, with the addition of the brain, vulcan can do all of the rays, just like mars can: the brain is -2 so can do everything except for receive desire, but since desire is a feeling or concept, -1 is capable as a function of -5 and so is a learned quality: a function of sensitivity and reception; vulcan becomes more black/sensitive/receptive/absorbative to everyone and everthing around: just like (the black) mars, but from reception instead of emission (desires are easy to emit: every time you see something unwanted, grotesque, or undesirable, desire for its improvement shoots out at a very high frequency. it'll be a long time before that that improvement manifests, and will take a whole lot more unwanted/grotesque/impure to produce more desire, so it becomes significant enough that it can manifest) vulcan is opposite: symbolically emissive, and receptive to concepts (which at a high enough frequency, is desire): quite naturally, he'll be attracting the manifestation of the desire, but it's vulcan's own symbolic output, that's prventing its reception [notice it's opposite the solar wind's relationship with the sun: corona prevents reception, and solar wind is output and prevents little reception, but for vulcan solar wind is input and corona is output and also prevents reception (just like for the sun)]. [also notice that rosalind (-5+) switches masks with the princess (-1) to create this effect. 5 and 1 are both the same thing, just desire is the output of high frequency and conceptual is also the reception/output of high frequency]. vulcans (IMO) are like one of the most versatile because of their *receptiveness* [I'm living proof of it]. mars/thoth will forever struggle to become conceptually receptive: if he tries to get too far out ahead of himself vibrationally (emissive of too much concept/desire without reception), he metaphorically is driving through an obstacle course at high speeds, so is like a pinball in the machine: not wanting to become receptive/black, he's now headed straight for his own disaster, just cause he wanted to push more than allow; or has to become physically receptive (+-4) and part of the saturian-system (earth's regulatory system): the infinitely producing amount of unwanted for earthings: one of the 4 aspects of desire.
so what this play can be seen as, is the quest for ganymede who (previously to their dedication to the king's 3y of study) was completely at the whim of jupiter; and now ganymede is studying to become, essentially superman: -1, just like the king.
the important thing about this play is that the females are seen as the counterparts to these vulcans (duke included). the females take the shape of vulcan's worst enemy. vulcan has four different aspects of desire which come out of the symbol that the vulcan is acting the part of (mercury, jupiter, mars?, and prometheus?). the girls are their reflectors, so isis, eve, venus, and anatau. the females are the *real* reason why these guys are going to figure out how to become supermen. instead of studying to become superman, they decide to instead woo (and win/earn) the girls instead. the play is a tragedy because though it appears a happy ending, I'm telling you these girls spell complete destruction for these guys, because they reflect on everything that is unwanted to them back to them
	for example, duke wants to limit communications, and being an idealist symbolically he's identified as 1st ray (not very receptive). so he, consequently gets paired with our lady (anatau), which wants everything to be open and known, so good luck with her, lol.
these girls will take down the ganymedes, just like the ganymedes took everyone around dido down: by reflecting their own symbol back to them in the form of concept (which is what creates/navigates reality) so reality that proved all of the ganymedes' feelings to be *right* (they love to be right about stuff), so it came to pass, *just like they said* (symbolically outputted) *it would happen*.
so these guys are totally going to have the worst worst time post-honymoon: a tragedy of the worst kind for these guys (along with thousands of virgins, of course). they think they're getting this really awesome manifestation, but it's literally also their worst fear becoming reality (our lady help my lord!)

so, what this play is actually all about (in my perspective and present situation), is for all of the girls that want to become superwomen: not to do it by manipulating conditions (like the girls in the play do), butt too instead see theirselves like the boys are (ganymedes) and marry yourself to your reflection (silvia/celia). everything that she thinks she wants in a man (or outside of her) will get reflected back to her in the form of reality. everything that ganymedes *pretends* he is, now he actually has to become (for realsies), which will requite some updates on some old concepts; which is easy cause it's just learn how to feel good and see everything the way I want to see it, instead of needing for it to be the way I see it (like vulcan the planet, not the human)

(08:30) the other interesting thing of note for this play, is the realism that baron brings to the table: he points out to the duke that there's no way possible way his idealistic efforts can possibly happen because he has to meet with the princess soon. hold that thought.
the way to userstand this aspect of role reversals, is to look at this from my perspective: all of the boys: longhead, howitzer, youman, and baron for me are all female vulcans: the opposite/desire aspect of the mother they come from: rosalind is venus, our lady is anatau, etc. therefore for m5, who will be *descending* from 1st position down to 5th position, this play is not so much about any single girl or any of that, but discovering (from a conceptual perspective) how desire manifests in each of the other rays: 2,4,5,7 (which coincidentally correspond with the girls), so when I see this play, all of the boys (longhead, howitzer, youman, and baron) are actually girls, and stragely, they'll be quite similar to their female counterparts as represented in the movie (again, very strange coincidence that it worked out like that). so now, if all of the boys and girls are just girls, then what this ends up becomming is actually a "no boys allowed" (cept the ones that aren't girls [notice oliver's conversion with a lioness (girl wearing a boy suit), and yields up a bloody hankerchief (first blood), so only girl-on-girl action in that setup] kinda situation. this sort of situation is quite desirable, and is very similar in symbolic resonance to the *amazons* (-3 women that only used men for procreation) or *sirens*. it's quite a desirable thing to want to just be sorta done with men -- and I fully agree with the ladies on that: I don't really want to hang around them at this point; it's mostly a bunch of unwanted feelings, and lots of problems. I'm the guy that wants to open everything up and expose all of the masks and stuff like that, so I'm a huge problem around people that like secrets (usually males and mother/krone), and I'm kinda done with all of their nonsense. I want to create things, and they want to keep a bunch of stuff away from others -- and I'm like: dude, so I want to make this thing (like a (social) network) and you don't want anyone to be able to use it?! it's necessary to have a crical mass of people in the group for it to become useful. so then, I'm sure they'll want to try and make it *exclusive* when I want to make it (not inclusive): only those that actually want to feel good, should join it. the last thing I want is a bunch of crabby people hanging around and bringing the place down, right? no thing worthwhile (or any thing of any quantity) is ever going to be a perfect fit for everyone, for that's why there are so many different stars out there: wanting to be different; to distinguish oneself from the others, is perfectly normal, and natural to desire. in fact, it's the first thing that one desires, and it's often times a lot of lifetimes to finally figure it out. all things are better when interacting with other people of *similarity* and *affinaty*. we're kinda "dividing the path" between those that *want* to feel good, and those that do *not* want to want to feel good.
from my perspective, this play, is taking about the unrealistic idea that we can actually sucessfully divide sides: they wanted to be be separate for even a little bit of time, but the girls are so physically attractive, they want them to stay ("you'll be purgured if I stay") -- and what ends up happening is lots of purgury: revealing of hidden and embarrassing things, sufficient enough for there to be a proper dividing of the path: feel-gooders on this side, and non-feel-gooders on the opposite side: the moon becomes our sun, and time runs so quickly, a day will seem as if a moonth of time has passed for each one.
	since the play has been written, a lot of technology improvements have taken place to make such a thing possible (definitely wasn't possible to do that in 1600), and also a lot of things have changed socially as well, xo

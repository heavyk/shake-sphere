### 2024-02-13 14:37 - which position?

in my present time, it appears that my present condition is prolly somewhere *very* 2nd ray. if I were take the position of saturn, then I ne
ither get to be pure-desire or [wow, I totally forgot what I was going to say. I remember it was about the disadvantages of saturn...]
	so, there are two ways to look at this: if I'm stuck ... [oh, geez I lost my train of thought again. this is going really poorly. I'll probably go eat some more weed and go take a walk].

you know, there's this really annoying thing which is that my position on the globe matters a lot. like, I affect weather and stuff tremendously, and I think that's one of the major problems that there is with here: because I have such a strong influence on the weather, I don't get to do things like watch stars.
ah, and that's another thing that's really annoying. I really dislike that I have to go through all of this genetics stuff, just so I can watch stars. I want to go back to being able to do that, and eventually I want to be able to have sex, without bringing down all major instutions. I also don't like how much of an effect the body has on the sun. it's emissive, and I want to be *attractive* only.

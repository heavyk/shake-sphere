### 2024-02-13 14:37 - which position?

in my present time, it appears that my present condition is prolly somewhere *very* 2nd ray. if I were take the position of saturn, then I ne
ither get to be pure-desire or [wow, I totally forgot what I was going to say. I remember it was about the disadvantages of saturn...]
	so, there are two ways to look at this: if I'm stuck ... [oh, geez I lost my train of thought again. this is going really poorly. I'll probably go eat some more weed and go take a walk].

you know, there's this really annoying thing which is that my position on the globe matters a lot. like, I affect weather and stuff tremendously, and I think that's one of the major problems that there is with here: because I have such a strong influence on the weather, I don't get to do things like watch stars.
ah, and that's another thing that's really annoying. I really dislike that I have to go through all of this genetics stuff, just so I can watch stars. I want to go back to being able to do that, and eventually I want to be able to have sex, without bringing down all major instutions. I also don't like how much of an effect the body has on the sun. it's emissive, and I want to be *attractive* only.

### 2024-02-13 16:16 - I want to be conceptually reflective

not like the boy vulcan, but like the girl, where she actually outputs conceptually, instead of only symbolically. the ability too only be receptive to light means that I'm a full mirror. all mirrors are black because they have to absorb everything in order to retransmit it. therefore, to be conceptually receptive, I have to be receptive to all frequencies. [huh, interesting. so this is kinda where the thought is starting to break down, because I want to be fully receptive to *concepts* (only), and not at all to symbol. like I just don't care what other people want to tell me (sometimes); yes, I know I'm a bit of a poser to *actually* being "anatau" -- like that's just the fastest frequency possible, because it's the farthest out. I quite have preferences, and so I'm much more like a 7th ray kinda robot, where I just do things. the thing is, because I'm so conceptually reflective, that also makes me a (lota) bit of an actor]
what I think is going to happen is that eventaully we're going to go way overboard on the 2nd ray energy, cause I haven't been able to make my body 100% conceptually receptive, meaning I'm not/am 2nd ray receptive, but not emissive. pure-desire has no desire to emit anything;-- that's why it's so far out there. it wants to be the most "out of the/everyone's way" ------ like the most far out, and not a bother to anyone. invisible, really.

### 2024-02-13 23:23 - put the blame on me

allow me to absorb everything
it won't even bother me a bit
it does reflect back on you so
take god care of yourself. now
the rest of it all you never will
see so just consider me the recipient
of everytheing invisible. just put the
blame on me, on the loudest thing nobody
has ever heard; now. I exist in the fastest
part of the universe: the farthest part out
the stuff nobody wants. there are preferences
theough which everyone has a slightly less than
black mirror, dull in some aspect.

# richard-2
## analysis
- notherumberland is there to enaure that the duke does not "let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath"
	- this is a running undertone in the play, because richard has sworn off the *court*, and is instead off with his fair youth queen (the 6yo girl). henry hereford/bolingbroke however isn't going to get caught up by some youthful pleasure like that though, and it looks like northumberland is there to ensure it.

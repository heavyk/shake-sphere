## breakdown
- new ideas in navarre:
	- 1939-09: ominous clouds of war threaten europe, so the young king of navarre (returning from *military munouvers*) announces he has an audacious plan for himself and *his court*:
		- (he and his companions are to):
			- cast off ther militry uniforms [leave *soldiering* behind] (while world events still allow (why?))
			- devote theirselves to 3y of study
			- sleep little
			- eat and drink less
			- devote theirselves tto an inspiring *program* of self-improvement
		- no women will be allowed inside the *court*
			- one exception: the king's principle tutor
	- king howitzer plans to show the world, there's more to life than guns and warfare [ie *soldiering*]
	- howitzer/king is an idealist [(all desire, no implenentation) "this plan's gonna last, how long?"]
- the 3 companions (baron, longhead, germain) are to live with king howitzer
- all 3 companions expect to pine [not expecting to make it]; most realistic of them is baron
	- quick observation: why are these guys wanting to study with the king? it seems the've been promised love (and probably happiness). they show up mentally already at the finish line. baron is the only "realistic" one, and he's just imagining the finish line coming sooner because *women will be allowed in court*. without this realistic realisation, these 3 were just going to spend 3y checked out, totally immersed in thier imaginations, and not in their *studies*.
	- longhead says the above (3 years I'll spend in my flourishing imagination)
		- his style of thinking is (2nd) stage of man: schoolboy (not wanting to do his sudies).
			- the kid doesn't want to do his studies because he is spending all of his time in his imagination, and imagination is *way* more fun than *studies*.
	- germain says something different: he celebrates the coming materiality of physical 3d pleasre.
		- thia style of thinking is (4th?) stage of man: lovah (everything is sighs and groans: phoebe! distraction! come to me please =).
			- ???? they're like kids that can't do anything productive in the moment, because thir mind is in a perceived future (christmas, vacation, new lovah, new game, new project, new work, whatever is *meaningful* (for the narrated items)
			- (and for everything not narrated): whatever he thinks will feel the best, or get the most pleasure).
				- this I beliveve is the selling-point here for shakespere: he puts into symbolic narration that it's OK to want these 3d virgins that will blow his mind away with incredible graphics. he just writes what no other playcorrect could ever do: casually put young virgins into a scene and not have it sound possessive; it sounded natural enough that it can be passed off as circumstantially believable conversation, that sounds really awesome.
	- baron wants to point out how unrealistic the whole idea is. he represents realism (I AM what I AM) of 3d physical realness.
		- this style of thinking is the (6th?) stage of man where he's a got an instace for everything.
			- the reason why he's got an instance for everything is cause he's got it all figured out: a complete structural system where everything can be explained and instanced in the mind (principle-tutor-letter)
	- baron reads the rules they are proposing:
		- longhead wants to punish anyone coming even even 1 mil from his *court*, by silencing any lavinia that wants to come near.
			- why? to cause them fear of such a violent punishment (very roman style of thinking: just crucify him)
		- howitzer wants to limit comminications. he doesn't want any talk at all with anyone that can pollute his thoughts, or likewise want the girls to know his thoughts.

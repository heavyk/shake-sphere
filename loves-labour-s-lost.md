## breakdown
- new ideas in navarre:
	- 1939-09: ominous clouds of war threaten europe, so the young king of navarre (returning from *military munouvers*) announces he has an audacious plan for himself and *his court*:
		- (he and his companions are to):
			- cast off ther militry uniforms [leave *soldiering* behind] (while world events still allow (why?)) [while saying this, it shows pictures of their uniforms: "bad boy barowne" "the king" "'DUKE' dumain(?)" "Lucky 7 longaville"]
			- devote theirselves to 3y of study
			- sleep little
			- eat and drink less
			- devote theirselves tto an inspiring *program* of self-improvement
		- no women will be allowed inside the *court*
			- one exception: the king's principle tutor
	- howitzer plans to show the world, there's more to life than guns and warfare [ie *soldiering*]
	- howitzer is an idealist [(all desire, no implenentation) "this plan's gonna last, how long?"]
- the 3 companions (baron, longhead, youman) are to live with howitzer
	- each of these display vulcan-like qualities (-5+), very much like me; which means vulcan will *receive* a concept (that resonates with how she feels) and then outputs a *symbolic* responce (words, plans, decrees, processes) which reflects the desire the concept is founded on. vulcan is conceptually reflective, very much like a 1st ray *lioness*, but not quite so pure in their desire (lioness's looking at it from top-down (universal-perspective: everything is a reflection of me), and vulcan from bottom-up: I attract the things around me that I want). so I will now refer to these characters as females: reflective -- though they are played by dull (non-reflecting) male characters. I'll distinguish between these two as ganymede and rosalind; vulcan is either.
- all 3 companions expect to pine [not expecting to make it]; most realistic of them is baron
	- quick observation: why are these guys wanting to study with the king? it seems the've been promised love (and probably happiness). they show up mentally already at the finish line. baron is the only "realistic" one, and he's just imagining the finish line coming sooner because *women will be allowed in court*. without this realistic realisation, these 3 were just going to spend 3y checked out, totally immersed in thier imaginations, and not in their *studies*.
	- longhead says the above (3 years I'll spend in my flourishing imagination)
		- his style of thinking is (2nd) stage of man: schoolboy (not wanting to do his sudies).
			- the kid doesn't want to do his studies because he is spending all of his time in his imagination, and imagination is *way* more fun than *studies*.
	- youman says something different: he celebrates the coming materiality of physical 3d pleasre.
		- thia style of thinking is (4th?) stage of man: lovah (everything is sighs and groans: phoebe! distraction! come to me please =).
			- ???? they're like kids that can't do anything productive in the moment, because thir mind is in a perceived future (christmas, vacation, new lovah, new game, new project, new work, whatever is *meaningful* (for the narrated items)
			- (and for everything not narrated): whatever he thinks will feel the best, or get the most pleasure).
				- this I beliveve is the selling-point here for shakespere: he puts into symbolic narration that it's OK to want these 3d virgins that will blow his mind away with incredible graphics. he just writes what no other playcorrect could ever do: casually put young virgins into a scene and not have it sound possessive; it sounded natural enough that it can be passed off as circumstantially believable conversation, that sounds really awesome.
	- baron wants to point out how unrealistic the whole idea is. he represents realism (I AM what I AM) of 3d physical realness.
		- this style of thinking is the (6th?) stage of man where he's a got an instace for everything.
			- the reason why he's got an instance for everything is cause he's got it all figured out: a complete structural system where everything can be explained and instanced in the mind (principle-tutor-letter)
- baron reads the rules they are proposing:
	- longhead wants to punish any woman coming even even 1 mil from his *court*, by silencing any lavinia that wants to come near.
		- 1 mil is probably referring to the 1000 virgins... I get the sense that he wants to complete his 1000 virgins stint, before any of the girls are able to speak (to eachother? about how terrible he was?).
		- why? to cause them *fear* of such a violent punishment (very roman style of thinking: just crucify him)
	- howitzer wants to limit comminications. any man that breaks the law and even talks to a woman will be punished with *public shame*
		- because howitzer is 1st ray perception, this probably means he doesn't want any talk with anyone that can pollute his thoughts. he wants to be focused and not constantly be distracted by idle chatter and worldly conversation. or, it's possible he *fears* the girls to knowing how he thinks about them, or knowing the contents of his *studies*: how desire works (ie, how to pick up girls.)
		- howitzer is going to preoject his fears/desires outwardly, which means that the foundation of his concept is fear of shame. he doesn't want others (especially the public) to know undesirale (the culture's calculated undesireable) things about him.
- turns out the french king's daughter is coming to *lie here* with the king (ie, work out a "deal"; these poor girls get sent off by their powerful monarch fathers like furnature, traded and used as bargaining chips in their political agendas, lol).
- and so because there's already a beautiful girl on the way because of the father's physical motivations (7 - opposite of desire), then they must allow this rule to be broken because of *necessity*, the basest form of desire (evolution-of-desire).
	- baron astutely points out that *necessity* will make them all to *forsworn* 3x1000 times (1000 virgins per year).
- baron decides to agree to the agreement saying "I am forsworn on mere *necessity*"
	- you know as a personal experience: when I lived in spain many people would ask me in bars why I didn't have girlfriends and stuff. I would tell them I had some really important mission that I wanted to build take over the world with computers and technology and stuff, and they'd look at me, having no concept of all of the technologies that I can conjure, and say "but don't you have *necessities?!?!*". I looked to them like a space alien because my desire to create technology is much higher than my desire for sex. spanish people perceive things that *need* to get done (the basest form of desire), because for them all other desire is *sexual desire*; thus they equate sexual desire with *necessity*.
- howitzer subscribes his name and says anyone who breaks the law stands in eternal *shame*
	- howitzer knows he will be permanently shamed and allowed for all the world to see his faults; it's unavoidable to him and he knows it, so he wants to remind the other vulcans that they too will also have the same *shame* as him; and, if they want to make it a *competition*, he bets he will be the last one to break his *oath* [lose his virginity].
- boye tells the girls that howitzer had notice of their fair approach
- boye says the *competetors* in *oath*, are briefed that they should meet the girls *before [boye] came* (where? first coming? second coming? he's already talking to the girls before they've seen the competitors). boye then explains what that means: "he intends to *lodge* you in the *field*"
	- the funny thing about this play is how silverclog is constantly saying symbolically sexual things by accident. [I can say from my experience, this happens to me a lot, and it's because a perception of desire (that is, looking at the motivation conceptually), often times means that I say the obvious thing, but it often sounds really sexual to others, becaUse they don't see it as *obvious* like I do] what's happening here is that because she's so busy looking at the obvious stuff, she only sees the material venir over the top -- so she's going to take that literally as being put out in a field. as a girl, it's quite a problem, but the cool thing is, that I personally love the field, and spend many nights out there watching stars. that's a totally cool thing for me; though, for her, this is getting off to a pretty bad start or misunderstanding and dishonesty when symbols aren't explicit for those that only look at the obvious. they'll get away with their symbolic misdirection and get married at the end (I think), but (I can see the end now) they're all literally marrying their *worst nightmares* (our lady help my lord - LOL)
- they meet the girls:
	- howitzer calls silverclog *fair* princess and welcomes her to his *land*. silverclog reflects fairness back to him, and tells him, *welcomed* him, she has not *yet*.
		- the *roof* of this *court* is too high to be his [lol, she has no idea what a *court* is], and *welcome* to the *wide fields* [like a prostitute, strumpet, or bawd] to base, to be hers.
	- howitzer responds to her reality check by saying: "you will be welcome to my court". he's admitting that he's overstepped, and is submitting to her punishment.
		- in saturnian thinking (like the conversation between othello and hiago), when a top/emitter oversteps himself and violates the code [of [proper] conduct/behaviour], he has to take it in the butt (as punishment).
	- silverclog says "I *will* be welcome to your *court*; conduct me thither [take me there]"
	- howitzer tells silverclog (deer lady) that he has *sworn* an *oath*.
	- silverclog (our lady) will help him become *forsworn*.
	- howitzer says he won't do it just because the *world* wants it, but by my *will* (his own penis? lol) - the concept is he wants to have sex with himself. he really likes himself, for whom now armado is to be materialised. "but by my [own] will" is also about him only being able to do things he wants to do (not cause others, the world, want him to do it).
	- silverclog says: "Why, *will* shall break it; *will* and nothing else" [lol, of course *will* will break the *oath*; what else would he put in her? a *spear*? and shake her around a bit?]. there's also the double meaning of her needing his conscent first.
	- howitzer: "Your ladyship is ignorant what it is." [lol, she have no idea what she just said]. there's also the double meaning of him thinking he's going to trick her into having sex.

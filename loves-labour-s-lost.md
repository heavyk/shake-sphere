## breakdown
- new ideas in navarre:
	- 1939-09: ominous clouds of war threaten europe, so the young king of navarre (returning from *military munouvers*) announces he has an audacious plan for himself and *his court*:
		- (he and his companions are to):
			- cast off ther militry uniforms [leave *soldiering* behind] (while world events still allow (why?))
			- devote theirselves to 3y of study
			- sleep little
			- eat and drink less
			- devote theirselves tto an inspiring *program* of self-improvement
		- no women will be allowed inside the *court*
			- one exception: the king's principle tutor
	- king plans to show the world, there's more to life than guns and warfare [ie *soldiering*]
	- king is an idealist ["yeah right it's gonna work"]
- the 3 companions are to live with the king (baron, longhead, germain)
- all 3 companions expect to pine [not expecting to make it]; most realistic of them is baron
	- quick observation: why are these guys wanting to study with the king? it seems the've been promised love (and probably happiness). they show up mentally already at the finish line. they're like kids that can't do anything productive in the moment, because thir mind is in a perceived future. baron is the only "realistic" one, and he's just imagining the finish line coming sooner because *women will be allowed in court*. without this realistic realisation, these 3 were just going to spend 3y checked out, totally immersed in thier imaginations, and not in their *studies*.
	 	- this style of thinking is explained as the (2nd?) stage of man where he's a schoolboy, not wanting to do his sudies. the kid doesn't want to do his studies because he is spending all of his time in his imagination, and imagination is *way* more fun than *studies*.
	- longhead says the above (3 years I'll spend in my flourishing imagination)
		- his style of thinking is schoolboy:
	- germain says something different: he celebrates the coming materiality of physical 3d pleasre.
	- baron wants to point out how unrealistic the whole idea is. he represents realism (I AM what I AM) of 3d physical realness.
		- his style of thinking is explained as the (6th?) stage of man where he's a got an instace for everything. the reason why he's got an instance for everything is cause he's got it all figured out: a complete structural system where everything can be explained and instanced in the mind (principle-tutor-letter)
